Foreword

On April 3, 2014, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence voted to send the
Findings and Conclusions and the Executive Summary of its final Study on the
CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program to the President for declassification
and subsequent public release.

This action marked the culmination ofa monumental effort that officially began
with the Committee's decision to initiate the Study in March 2009, but which had
its roots in an investigation into the CIA's destruction of videotapes of CIA
detainee interrogations that beganin December 2007.

The full Committee Study, which totals more than 6,700 pages, remains classified
but is now an official Senate report. The full report has been provided to the White
House, the CIA, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, the

Department of State, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the
hopes that it will prevent future coercive interrogation practices and inform the
management of other covert action programs.
As the Chairman of the Committee since 2009,1 write to offer some additional

views, context, and history.

I began my service on the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2001. I
remember testimony that summer from George Tenet, the Director of Central
Intelligence, that warned of a possible major terrorist event against the United
States, but without specifics on the time, location, or method of attack. On

September 11, 2001, the world learned the answers to those questions that had

consumed the CIA and other parts of the U.S. Intelligence Community.^
I recall vividly watching the horror of that day, to include the television footage of
innocent men and women jumping out of the World Trade Center towers to escape
the fire. The images, and the sounds as their bodies hit the pavement far below,
will remain with me for the rest of my life.

It is against that backdrop - the largest attack against the American homeland in
our history - that the events described in this report were undertaken.
' For information on the events at the CIA prior to September 11, 2001, see the Final Report ofthe National
Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon theUnited States (9/11 Commission) and Office of theInspector General
Report on CIA Accountability With Respect to the 9/11 Attacks.

Nearly 13 years later, the Executive Summary and Findings and Conclusions of
this report are being released. They are highly critical of the CIA's actions, and
rightfully so. Reading them, it is easy to forget the context in which the program
began - not that the context should serve as an excuse, but rather as a warning for
the future.

It is worth remembering the pervasive fear in late 2001 and how immediate the
threat felt. Just a week after the September 11 attacks, powdered anthrax was sent
to various news organizations and to two U.S. Senators. The American public was
shocked by news of new terrorist plots and elevations of the color-coded threat
level of the Homeland Security Advisory System. We expected further attacks
against the nation.

I have attempted throughout to remember the impact on the nation and to the CIA
workforce from the attacks of September 11, 2001. I can understand the CIA's
impulse to consider the use of every possible tool to gather intelligence and remove

terrorists from the battlefield,^ and CIA was encouraged by political leaders and
the public to do whatever it could to prevent another attack.
The Intelligence Committee as well often pushes intelligence agencies to act
quickly in response to threats and world events.
Nevertheless, such pressure, fear, and expectation of further terrorist plots do not
justify, temper, or excuse improper actions taken by individuals or organizations in
the name of national security. The major lesson of this report is that regardless of
the pressures and the need to act, the Intelligence Community's actions must
always reflect who we are as a nation, and adhere to our laws and standards. It is
precisely at these times of national crisis that our government must be guided by
the lessons of our history and subject decisions to internal and external review.
Instead, CIA personnel, aided by two outside contractors, decided to initiate a
program of indefinite secret detention and the use of brutal interrogation
techniques in violation of U.S. law, treaty obligations, and our values.

This Conomittee Study documents the abuses and countless mistakes made
between late 2001 and early 2009. The Executive Summary of the Study provides
^It is worth repeating that the covert action authorities approved bythe President in September 2001 didnotprovide
any authorization or contemplate coercive interrogations.

Page 2 of 6

UNCLASSIFIED

a significant amount ofnew information, based on CIA and other documents, to

what has already been made public by the Bush and Obama Administrations,' as

well as non-governmental organizations and the press.

The Committee's full Study is more than ten times the length of the Executive

Sununary and includes comprehensive and excruciating detail. The Study
describes the history ofthe CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program from its
inception to its termination, including a review of each of the 119 known
individuals who were held in CIA custody.

The full Conmiittee Study also provides substantially more detail than what is
included in the Executive Summary on the CIA's justification and defense of its
interrogation program on the basis that it was necessary and critical to the
disruption of specific terrorist plots and the capture of specific terrorists. While the
Executive Summary provides sufficient detail to demonstrate the inaccuracies of

each of these claims, the information in the full Committee Study is far more
extensive.

I chose not to seek declassification of the full Committee Study at this time. I
believe that the Executive Summary includes enough information to adequately
describe the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, and the Committee's
Findings and Conclusions cover the entirety of the program. Seeking
declassification of the more than six thousand page report would have significantly
delayed the release of the Executive Summary. Decisions will be made later on the
declassification and release of the full 6,700 page Study.
In 2009, when this effort began, I stated (in a press release co-authored with the
Vice Chairman of the Committee, Senator Kit Bond) that "the purpose is to review
the program and to shape detention and interrogation policies in the future." The
review is now done. It is my sincere and deep hope that through the release of
these Findings and Conclusions and Executive Summary that U.S. policy will
never again allow for secret indefinite detention and the use of coercive

interrogations. As the Study describes, prior to the attacks of September 2001, the
CIA itself determined from its own experience with coercive interrogations, that
such techniques "do not produce intelligence," "will probably result in false
answers," and had historically proven to be ineffective. Yet these conclusions

were ignored. We cannot again allow history to be forgotten and grievous past
mistakes to be repeated.

President Obama signed Executive Order 13491 in January 2009 to prohibit the
CIA from holding detainees other than on a "short-term, transitory basis" and to
limit interrogation techniques to those includedin the Army Field Manual.
However, these limitations are not part of U.S. law and could be overturned by a
future president with the stroke of a pen. They should be enshrined in legislation.
Even so, existing U.S. law and treaty obligations should have prevented many of
the abuses and mistakes made during this program. While the Office of Legal
Counsel found otherwise between 2002 and 2007, it is my personal conclusion
that, under any common meaning of the term, CIA detainees were tortured. I also
believe that the conditions of confinement and the use of authorized and

unauthorized interrogation and conditioning techniques were cruel, inhuman, and
degrading. I believe the evidence of this is overwhelming and incontrovertible.
While the Conmiittee did not make specific recommendations, several emerge
from the Committee's review. The CIA, in its June 2013 response to the
Committee's Study from December 2012, has also already made and begun to
implement its own recommendations. I intend to work with Senate colleagues to
produce recommendations and to solicit views from the readers of the Committee
Study.

I would also like to take this opportunity to describe the process of this study.
As noted previously, the Committee approved the Terms of Reference for the
Study in March 2009 and began requesting information from the CIA and other
federal departments. The Committee, through its staff, had already reviewed in
2008 thousands of CIA cables describing the interrogations of the CIA detainees
Abu Zubaydah and 'Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, whose interrogations were the
subject of videotapes that were destroyed by the CIA in 2005.
The 2008 review was complicated by the existence of a Department of Justice
investigation, opened by Attorney Geiieral Michael Mukasey, into the destruction
of the videotapes and expanded by Attomey General Holder in August 2009. In
particular, CIA employees and contractors who would otherwise have been
interviewed by the Committee staff were under potential legal jeopardy, and
therefore the CIA would not compel its workforce to appear before the Committee.
This constraint lasted until the Committee's research and documentary review
were completed and the Committee Study had largely been finalized.

Page 4 of 6
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

Furthermore, given the volume and internal nature ofrelevant CIA documents, the
CIA insisted that the Committee enter into an arrangement where our staff would

revie^ocuments and conduct research at aCIA-leased facility |
rather than at the Committee's offices on Capitol Hill.
From early 2009 to late 2012, a small group of Committee staffreviewed the more

than six million pages of CIA materials, to include operational cables, intelligence
reports, internal memoranda and emails, briefing materials, interview transcripts,
contracts, and other records. Draft sections of the Study were prepared and
distributed to the full Committee membership beginning in October 2011 and this
process continued through to the Committee's vote to approve the full Committee
Study on December 13,2012.

The breadth of documentary material onwhich the Study relied and which the
Committee Study cites is unprecedented. While the Committee did not interview

CIA officials in the context of the Committee Study, it had access to and drew

from the interviews ofnumerous CIA officials conducted by the CIA's Inspector
General and the CIA Oral History program on subjects that lie at the heart of the
Committee Study, as well as past testimony to the Committee.

Following the December 2012 vote, the Committee Study was sent to the President
and appropriate parts ofthe Executive Branch for comments by February 15, 2013.
The CIA responded in late June 2013 with extensive comments on the Findings
and Conclusions, based in part on the responses of CIA officials involved in the
program. At my direction, the Committee staffmet with CIA representatives in
orderto fully understand the CIA's comments, and then incorporated suggested
edits or comments as appropriate.

The Committee Study, including the now-declassified Executive Summary and
Findings and Conclusions, as updated is now final and represents the official views
of the Committee. This and future Administrations should use this Study to guide
future programs, correct past mistakes, increase oversight of CIA representations
to policymakers, and ensure coercive interrogation practices are not used by our
government again.

Finally, I want to recognize the members of the staffwho haveendured years of
long hours poring through the difficult details of one of the lowest points in our
nation's history. They have produced the most significant and comprehensive
oversight report in the Committee's history, and perhaps in that of the U.S. Senate,
and their contributions should be recognized and praised.

Daniel Jones has managed and led the Committee's review effort from its

inception. Dan has devoted more than six years to this effort, has personally
written thousands of its pages, and has been integrallyinvolved in every Study
decision. Evan Gottesman, Chad Tanner, and Alissa Starzak have also played
integral roles in the Committee Study and have spent considerable years
researching and drafting specific sections of the Committee Study.
Other Comumittee staff members have also assisted in the review and provided
valuable contributions at the direction of our Committee Members. They include,
among others, Jennifer Barrett, Nick Basciano, Michael Buchwald, Jim Catella,
Eric Chapman, John Dickas, Lorenzo Goco, Andrew Grotto, Tressa Guenov, Clete
Johnson, Michael Noblet, Michael Pevzner, Tonmiy Ross, Caroline Tess, and
James Wolfe. The Conmiittee's Staff Director throughout the review, David
Grannis, has played a central role in assisting me and guiding the Conmiittee
through this entire process. Without the expertise, patience, and work ethic of our
able staff, our Members would not have been able to complete this most important
work.

The Committee makes the following findings and conclusions:
#1: The CIA's use of its enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of
acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees.

The Committee fmds, based on a review of CIA interrogation records, that the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of obtaining accurate information
or gaining detainee cooperation.

For example, according to CIA records, seven of the 39 CIA detainees known to have been

subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques produced no intelligence while in CIA

custody.* CIA detainees who were subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques
were usually subjected to the techniques immediately after being rendered to CIA custody.
Other detainees provided significant accurate intelligence prior to, or without having been
subjected to these techniques.

While being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and afterwards, multiple
CIA detainees fabricated information, resulting in faulty intelligence. Detainees provided
fabricated information on critical intelligence issues, including the terrorist threats which the
CIA identified as its highest priorities.

At numerous times thi'oughout the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, CIA personnel
assessed that the most effective method for acquiring intelligence from detainees, including from
detainees the CIA considered to be the most "high-value," was to confront the detainees with
information already acquired by the Intelligence Community. CIA officers regularly called into
question whether the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were effective, assessing that the
use of the techniques failed to elicit detainee cooperation or produce accurate intelligence.

#2: The CIA's justification for the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques rested on
inaccurate claims of their effectiveness.

The CIA represented to the White House, the National Security Council, the Department of
Justice, the CIA Office of Inspector General, the Congress, and the public that the best measure
of effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was examples of specific
terrorist plots "thwarted" and specific terrorists captured as a result of the use of the techniques.
The CIA used these examples to claim that its enhanced interrogation techniques were not only
effective, but also necessary to acquire "otherwise unavailable" actionable intelligence that
"saved lives."

The Committee reviewed 20 of the most frequent and prominent examples of purported
counterterrorism successes that the CIA has attributed to the use of its enhanced interrogation
techniques, and found them to be wrong in fundamental respects. In some cases, there was no
relationship between the cited counterterrorism success and any information provided by
detainees during or after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. In the
Kll

II III I

Page 2 of 19

UNCLASSIFIED

remaining cases, the CIA inaccurately claimed that specific, otherwise unavailable information
was acquired from a CIA detainee "as a result" of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques,
when in fact the information was either: (1) corroborative of information already available to the

CIA or other elements of the U.S. Intelligence Community from sources other than the CIA
detainee, and was therefore not "otherwise unavailable"; or (2) acquired from the CIA detainee
prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. The examples provided by the
CIA included numerous factual inaccuracies.

In providing the "effectiveness" examples to policymakers, the Department of Justice, and
others, the CIA consistently omitted the significant amount of relevant intelligence obtained
from sources other than CIA detainees who had been subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniquesâleaving the false impression the CIA was acquiring unique
information from the use of the techniques.

Some of the plots that the CIA claimed to have "disrupted" as a result of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques were assessed by intelligence and law enforcement officials as being
infeasible or ideas that were never operationalized.

#3: The interrogations of CIA detainees were brutal and far worse than the CIA
represented to policymakers and others.

Beginning with the CIA's first detainee, Abu Zubaydah, and continuing with numerous others,
the CIA applied its enhanced interrogation techniques with significant repetition for days or
weeks at a time. Interrogation techniques such as slaps and "wallings" (slamming detainees
against a wall) were used in combination, frequently concurrent with sleep deprivation and
nudity. Records do not support CIA representations that the CIA initially used an "an open, non-

threatening approach,"^ or that interrogations began with the "least coercive technique possible"^
and escalated to more coercive techniques only as necessary.

The waterboarding technique was physically harmful, inducing convulsions and vomiting. Abu
Zubaydah, for example, became "completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open,
full mouth.'"^ Internal CIA records describe the waterboarding of Khalid Shaykh Mohammad as

evolving into a "series of near drownings."^
Sleep deprivation involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours, usually standing or in
stress positions, at times with their hands shackled above their heads. At least five detainees
experienced disturbing hallucinations during prolonged sleep deprivation and, in at least two of
those cases, the CIA nonetheless continued the sleep deprivation.

Contrary to CIA representations to the Department of Justice, the CIA instructed personnel that

the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah would take "precedence" over his medical care,^ resulting in
the deterioration of a bullet wound Abu Zubaydah incurred during his capture. In at least two
other cases, the CIA used its enhanced interrogation techniques despite warnings from CIA
medical personnel that the techniques could exacerbate physical injuries. CIA medical personnel

treated at least one detainee for swelling in order to allow the continued use of standing sleep
deprivation.

At least five CIA detainees were subjectedto "rectal rehydration" or rectal feeding without
documented medical necessity. The CIA placed detainees in ice water "baths." The CIA led

several detainees to believe they would never be allowed to leave CIA custody alive, suggesting
to one detainee that he would only leave in a coffin-shaped box.^ One interrogator told another
detainee that he would never go to court, because "we can never let the world know what I have

done to you."^ CIA officers also threatened at least three detainees withharm to theirfamiliesâ
to include threats to harm the children of a detainee, threats to sexually abuse the mother of a
detainee, and a threat to "cut [a detainee's] mother's throat."^

#4: The conditions of confinement for CIA detainees were harsher than the CIA had

represented to policymakers and others.

Conditions at CIA detention sites were poor, and were especially bleak early in the program.
CIA detainees at the COBALT detention facility were kept in complete darkness and constantly
shackled in isolated cells with loud noise or music and only a bucket to use for human waste.
Lack of heat at the facility likely contributed to the death of a detainee. The chief of

interrogations described COBALT as a "dungeon."^^ Another seniorCIA officer stated that
COBALT was itself an enhanced interrogation technique.^'
At times, the detainees at COBALT were walked around naked or were shackled with their

hands above their heads for extended periods of time. Other times, the detainees at COBALT
were subjected to what was described as a "rough takedown," in which approximately five CIA
officers would scream at a detainee, drag him outside of his cell, cut his clothes off, and secure

him with Mylar tape. The detainee would then be hooded and dragged up and down a long
corridor while being slapped and punched.

Even after the conditions of confinement improved with the construction of new detention
facilities, detainees were held in total isolation except when being interrogated or debriefed by
CIA personnel.

Throughout the program, multiple CIA detainees who were subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques and extended isolation exhibited psychological and behavioral issues,
including hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, and attempts at self-harm and self-mutilation.
Multiple psychologists identified the lack of human contact experienced by detainees as a cause
of psychiatric problems.

#5: The CIA repeatedly provided inaccurate information to the Department of Justice,
impeding a proper legal analysis of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.
From 2002 to 2007, the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) within the Department of Justice relied
on CIA representations regarding: (1) the conditions of confinement for detainees, (2) the
Kli

'iM III 1

Page 4 of 19
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

applicationof the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, (3) the physical effects of the
techniques on detainees, and (4) the effectiveness of the techniques. Those representations were
inaccurate in material respects.

The Department of Justice did not conduct independent analysis or verification of the
information it received from the CIA. The department warned, however, that if the facts
provided by the CIA were to change, its legal conclusions might not apply. When the CIA
determined that information it had provided to the Department of Justice was incorrect, the CIA
rarely informed the department.

Prior to the initiation of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program and throughout the life
of the program, the legal justifications for the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques relied on
the CIA's claim that the techniques were necessary to save lives. In late 2001 and early 2002,
senior attorneys at the CIA Office of General Counsel first examined the legal implications of
using coercive interrogation techniques. CIA attorneys stated that "a novel application of the
necessity defense" could be used "to avoid prosecution of U.S. officials who tortured to obtain

information that saved many lives."^^^
Having reviewed information provided by the CIA, the OLC included the "necessity defense" in
its August 1, 2002, memorandum to the White House counsel on Standards of Conduct for
Interrogation. The OLC determined that "under the cun*ent circumstances, necessity or selfdefense may justify interrogation methods that might violate" the criminal prohibition against
torture.

On the same day, a second OLC opinion approved, for the first time, the use of 10 specific
coercive interrogation techniques against Abu Zubaydahâsubsequently referred to as the CIA's
"enhanced interrogation techniques." The OLC relied on inaccurate CIA representations about
Abu Zubaydah's status in al-Qa'ida and the interrogation team's "certain[ty]" that Abu
Zubaydah was withholding information about planned terrorist attacks. The CIA's
representations to the OLC about the techniques were also inconsistent with how the techniques
would later be applied.

In March 2005, the CIA submitted to the Department of Justice various examples of the
"effectiveness" of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques that were inaccurate. OLC
memoranda signed on May 30, 2005, and July 20, 2007, relied on these representations,

determining that the techniques were legal in part because they produced "specific, actionable
intelHgence" and "substantial quantities of otherwise unavailable intelligence" that saved lives.

#6: The CIA has actively avoided or impeded congressional oversight of the program.
The CIA did not brief the leadership of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques until September 2002, after the techniques had been
approved and used. The CIA did not respond to Chairman Bob Graham's requests for additional
information in 2002, noting in its own internal communications that he would be leaving the
Committee in Januai-y 2003. The CIA subsequently resisted efforts by Vice Chairman John D.

Rockefeller IV, to investigate the program, including by refusing in 2006 to provide requested
documents to the full Committee.

The CIA restricted access to information about the program from members of the Committee
beyond the chairman and vice chairman until September 6, 2006, the day the president publicly
acknowledged the program, by which time 117 of the 119 known detainees had already entered
CIA custody. Until then, the CIA had declined to answer questions fi"om other Committee
members that related to CIA inteiTogation activities.

Prior to September 6, 2006, the CIA provided inaccurate information to the leadership of the
Committee. Briefings to the full Conmiittee beginning on September 6, 2006, also contained
numerous inaccui*acies, including inaccurate descriptions of how interrogation techniques were
applied and what information was obtained from CIA detainees. The CIA misrepresented the
views of members of Congress on a number of occasions. After multiple senators had been
critical of the program and written letters expressing concerns to CIA Director Michael Hayden,
Director Hayden nonetheless told a meeting of foreign ambassadors to the United States that
every Committee member was "fully briefed," and that "[t]his is not CIA's program. This is not

the President's program. This is America's program."^^ The CIA also provided inaccurate
information describing the views of U.S. senators about the program to the Department of
Justice.

A year after being briefed on the program, the House and Senate Conference Committee
considering the Fiscal Year 2008 Intelligence Authorization bill voted to limit the CIA to using
only interrogation techniques authorized by the Army Field Manual. That legislation was
approved by the Senate and the House of Representatives in Febniary 2008, and was vetoed by
President Bush on March 8, 2008.

#7: The CIA impeded effective White House oversight and decision-making.
The CIA provided extensive amounts of inaccurate and incomplete information related to the
operation and effectiveness of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program to the White
House, the National Security Council principals, and their staffs. This prevented an accurate and
complete understanding of the program by Executive Branch officials, thereby impeding
oversight and decision-making.

According to CIA records, no CIA officer, up to and including CIA Directors George Tenet and
Porter Goss, briefed the president on the specific CIA enhanced interrogation techniques before
April 2006. By that time, 38 of the 39 detainees identified as having been subjected to the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques had already been subjected to the techniques.The CIA did
not inform the president or vice president of the location of CIA detention facilities other than
Country
At the direction of the White House, the secretaries of state and defense - both principals on the
National Security Council - were not briefed on program specifics until September 2003. An

internal CIA email from July 2003 noted that "... the WH [White House] is extremely concerned

[Secretary] Powell would blow his stack if he were to be briefed on what's been going on."^^
Deputy Secretary of State Armitage complained that he and Secretary Powell were "cut out" of

the National Security Council coordination process.^Â®
The CIA repeatedly provided incomplete and inaccurate information to White House personnel
regarding the operation and effectiveness of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.
This includes the provision of inaccurate statements similar to those provided to other elements
of the U.S. Government and later to the public, as well as instances in which specific questions
from White House officials were not answered truthfully or fully. In briefings for the National
Security Council principals and White House officials, the CIA advocated for the continued use
of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, warning that "[tjermination of this program will

result in loss of life, possibly extensive."^^
#8: The CIA's operation and management of the program complicated, and in some cases
impeded, the national security missions of other Executive Branch agencies.
The CIA, in the conduct of its Detention and Interrogation Program, complicated, and in some
cases impeded, the national security missions of other Executive Branch agencies, including the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the State Department, and the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence (ODNI). The CIA withheld or restricted information relevant to these
agencies' missions and responsibilities, denied access to detainees, and provided inaccurate
information on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program to these agencies.

The use of coercive interrogation techniques and covert detention facilities that did not meet
traditional U.S. standards resulted in the FBI and the Department of Defense limiting their
involvement in CIA interrogation and detention activities. This reduced the ability of the U.S.
Government to deploy available resources and expert personnel to interrogate detainees and
operate detention facilities. The CIA denied specific requests from FBI Director Robert Mueller
III for FBI access to CIA detainees that the FBI believed was necessary to understand CIA

detainee reporting on threats to the U.S. Homeland. Information obtained from CIA detainees
was restricted within the Intelhgence Community, leading to concerns among senior CIA
officers that Hmitations on sharing information undermined government-wide counterterrorism
analysis.
The CIA blocked State Department leadership from access to information crucial to foreign
policy decision-making and diplomatic activities. The CIA did not inform two secretaries of
state of locations of CIA detention facilities, despite the significant foreign policy implications
related to the hosting of clandestine CIA detention sites and the fact that the political leaders of
host countries were generally informed of their existence. Moreover, CIA officers told U.S.
ambassadors not to discuss the CIA program with State Department officials, preventing the
ambassadors from seeking guidance on the policy implications of establishing CIA detention
facilities in the countries in which they served.
In two countries, U.S. ambassadors were informed of plans to establish a CIA detention site in
the countries where they were serving after the CIA had already entered into agreements with the

11 III I

countries to host the detention sites. In two other countries where negotiations on hosting new
CIA detention facilities were taking place,the CIA told local government officials not to
inform the U.S. ambassadors.

The ODNI was providedwith inaccurate and incomplete information about the program,
preventing the director of national intelligencefrom effectively carrying out the director's
statutory responsibility to serve as the principal advisor to the president on intelligence matters.
The inaccurate information provided to the ODNI by the CIA resulted in the ODNI releasing
inaccurate information to the public in September 2006.

#9; The CIA impeded oversight by the CIA's Office of Inspector General.
The CIA avoided, resisted, and otherwise impeded oversight of the CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program by the CIA's Office oHnspector General (OIG). The CIA did not brief
the OIG on the program until after the death of a detainee, by which time the CIA had held at
least 22 detainees at two different CIA detention sites. Once notified, the OIG reviewed the

CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program and issued several reports, including an important
May 2004 "Special Review" of the program that identified significant concerns and deficiencies.
During the OIG reviews, CIA personnel provided OIG with inaccurate information on the
operation and management of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, as well as on the
effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. The inaccurate information was
included in the final May 2004 Special Review, which was later declassified and released
publicly, and remains uncorrected.

In 2005, CIA Director Goss requested in writing that the inspector general not initiate further
reviews of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program until reviews already underway were
completed. In 2007, Director Hayden ordered an unprecedented review of the OIG itself in
response to the OIG's inquiries into the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.

#10: The CIA coordinated the release of classified information to the media, including
inaccurate information concerning the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques.
The CIA's Office of Public Affairs and senior CIA officials coordinated to share classified

information on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program to select members of the media to
counter public criticism, shape public opinion, and avoid potential congressional action to restrict
the CIA's detention and inteiTogation authorities and budget. These disclosures occurred when
the program was a classified covert action program, and before the CIA had briefed the full
Committee membership on the program.

The deputy director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center wrote to a colleague in 2005, shortly
before being interviewed by a media outlet, that "we either get out and sell, or we get hammered,
which has implications beyond the media. [C]ongress reads it, cuts our authorities, messes up

our budget... we either put out our story or wegeteaten. [T]here is no middle ground."^ The
same CIA officer explained to a colleague that "when the [Washington Post]/[New York Tjimes
quotes 'senior intelligence official,' it's us... authorized and directed by opa [CIA's Office of
Public Affairs].

Much of the information the CIA provided to the media on the operation of the CIA's Detention
and Interrogation Program and the effectiveness of its enhanced inteiTogation techniques was
inaccurate and was similar to the inaccurate information provided by the CIA to the Congress,
the Department of Justice, and the White House.

#11: The CIA was unprepared as it began operating its Detention and Interrogation
Program more than six months after being granted detention authorities.
On September 17, 2001, the President signed a covert action Memorandum of Notification
(MON) granting the CIA unprecedented counterterrorism authorities, including the authority to
covertly capture and detain individuals "posing a continuing, serious threat of violence or death
to U.S. persons and interests or planning terrorist activities." The MON made no reference to
interrogations or coercive interrogation techniques.
The CIA was not prepared to take custody of its first detainee. In the fall of 2001, the CIA
explored the possibility of establishing clandestine detention facilities in several countries. The
CIA's review identified risks associated with clandestine detention that led it to conclude that

U.S. military bases were the best option for the CIA to detain individuals under the MON
authorities. In late March 2002, the imminent capture of Abu Zubaydah prompted the CIA to
again consider various detention options. In part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the
International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a U.S.
militaiy base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a

facility inCountry |âa country that had not previously been considered as a potential host for a
CIA detention site. A senior CIA officer indicated that the CIA "will have to acknowledge

certain gaps in ourplanning/preparations,""^ butstated that this plan would be presented to the
president. At a Presidential Daily Briefing session that day, the president approved CIA's

proposal to detain Abu Zubaydah in Country |.
The CIA lacked a plan for the eventual disposition of its detainees. After taking custody of Abu
Zubaydah, CIA officers concluded that he "should remain incommunicado for the remainder of
his life," which "may preclude [Abu Zubaydah] from being turned over to another country.
The CIA did not review its past experience with coercive interrogations, or its previous statement
to Congress that "inhumane physical or psychological techniques are counterproductive because

they do not produce intelligence and will probably result in false answers."-^ The CIA also did
not contact other elements of the U.S. Government with interrogation expertise.

In July 2002, on the basis of consultations with contract psychologists, and with very limited
internal deliberation, the CIA requested approval from the Department of Justice to use a set of
coercive interrogation techniques. The techniques were adapted from the training of U.S.

military personnel at the U.S. Air Force Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE)
school, which was designed to prepare U.S. military personnel for the conditions and treatment
to which they might be subjected if taken prisoner by countries that do not adhere to the Geneva
Conventions.

As it began detention and interrogation operations, the CIA deployed personnel who lacked
relevant training and experience. The CIA began interrogation training more than seven months
after taking custody of Abu Zubaydah, and more than thi'ee months after the CIA began using its
"enhanced inteiTogation techniques." CIA Director George Tenet issued formal guidelines for
interrogations and conditions of confinement at detention sites in January 2003, by which time
40 of the 119 known detainees had been detained by the CIA.

#12: The CIA's management and operation of its Detention and Interrogation Program
was deeply flawed throughout the program's duration, particularly so in 2002 and early
2003.

The CIA's COBALT detention facility in Country | began operations inSeptember 2002 and
ultimately housed more than half of the 119 CIA detainees identified in this Study. The CIA
kept few formal records of the detainees in its custody at COBALT. Untrained CIA officers at
the facility conducted frequent, unauthorized, and unsupervised interrogations of detainees using
harsh physical interrogation techniques that were notâand never becameâpart of the CIA's

formal "enhanced" interrogation program. The CI^)laced ajunior officer with no relevant
experience in charge of COBALT. On November jf, 2002, adetainee who had been held
partially nude and chained to a concrete floor died from suspected hypothermia at the facility.
At the time, no single unit at CIA Headquarters had clear responsibility for CIA detention and
interrogation operations. In interviews conducted in 2003 with the Office of Inspector General,
CIA's leadership and senior attorneys acknowledged that they had little or no awareness of
operations at COBALT, and some believed that enhanced interrogation techniques were not used
there.

Although CIA Director Tenet in January 2003 issued guidance for detention and interrogation
activities, serious management problems persisted. For example, in December 2003, CIA
personnel reported that they had made the "unsettling discovery" that the CIA had been "holding
a number of detainees about whom" the CIA knew "very litde" at multiple detention sites in

Country i.-'
Divergent lines of authority for interrogationactivities persisted through at least 2003. Tensions
among interrogators extended to complaints about the safety and effectiveness of each other's
interrogation practices.

The CIA placed individuals with no applicable experience or training in senior detention and
interrogation roles, and providedinadequate linguistic and analytical support to conduct effective
questioning of CIA detainees, resulting in diminished intelligence. The lack of CIA personnel
available to question detainees, which the CIA inspector general referred to as "an ongoing
problem,persisted throughout the program.
1(11

In 2005, the chief of the CIA's BLACK detention site, where many of the detainees the CIA
assessed as "high-value" were held, complained that CIA Headquarters "managers seem to be
selecting either problem, underperforming officers, new, totally inexperienced officers or

whomever seems to be willing and able to deploy at any given time," resulting in "the production
of mediocre or, I dare say, useless intelligence.
Numerous CIA officers had serious documented personal and professional problemsâincluding
histories of violence and records of abusive ti'eatment of othersâthat should have called into

question their suitability to participatein the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, their
employment with the CIA, and their continued access to classified information. In nearly all
cases, these problems were known to the CIA prior to the assignment of these officers to
detention and interrogation positions.

#13: Two contract psychologists devised the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and
played a central role in the operation, assessments, and management of the CIA's
Detention and Interrogation Program. By 2005, the CIA had overwhelmingly outsourced
operations related to the program.

The CIA contracted with two psychologists to develop, operate, and assess its interrogation
operations. The psychologists' prior experience was at the U.S. Air Force Survival, Evasion,
Resistance and Escape (SERE) school. Neither psychologist had any experience as an
interrogator, nor did either have specialized knowledge of al-Qa'ida, a background in
counterterrorism, or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise.
On the CIA's behalf, the contract psychologists developed theories of interrogation based on

"learned helplessness,"^^ and developed the list of enhanced inteiTogation techniques that was
approved for use against Abu Zubaydah and subsequent CIA detainees. The psychologists
personally conducted interrogations of some of the CIA's most significant detainees using these
techniques. They also evaluated whether detainees' psychological state allowed for the
continued use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, including some detainees whom
they were themselves interrogating or had interrogated. The psychologists carried out inherently
governmental functions, such as acting as liaison between the CIA and foreign intelligence
services, assessing the effectiveness of the interrogation program, and participating in the
interrogation of detainees in held in foreign government custody.
In 2005, the psychologists formed a company specifically for the purpose of conducting their
work with the CIA. Shortly thereafter, the CIA outsourced vktually all aspects of the program.
In 2006, the value of the CIA's base conti"act with the company formed by the psychologists with

all options exercised was in excess of $180 million; the contractors received $81 million prior to
the contract's termination in 2009. In 2007, the CIA provided a multi-year indemnification
agreement to protect the company and its employees from legal liability arising out of the

program. The CIA has since paid out more than $1 million pursuant to the agreement.

In 2008, the CIA's Rendition, Detention, and Interrogation Group, the lead unit for detention and

interrogation opera^ns at the CIA, had atotal of
staff officers and

positions, which were filled with | CIA

contractors, meaning that contractors made up 85% of the workforce for

detention and interrogation operations.

#14: CIA detainees were subjected to coercive interrogation techniques that had not been
approved by the Department of Justice or had not been authorized by CIA Headquarters.
Prior to mid-2004, the CIA routinely subjected detainees to nudity and dietary manipulation.
The CIA also used abdominal slaps and cold water dousing on several detainees during that
period. None of these techniques had been approved by the Department of Justice.
At least 17 detainees were subjected to CIA enhanced interrogation techniques without
authorization from CIA Headquarters. Additionally, multiple detainees were subjected to
techniques that were applied in ways that diverged from the specific authorization, or were
subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques by interrogators who had not been authorized to
use them. Although these incidents were recorded in CIA cables and, in at least some cases were
identified at the time by supervisors at CIA Headquarters as being inappropriate, corrective
action was rarely taken against the interrogators involved.

#15: The CIA did not conduct a comprehensive or accurate accounting of the number of
individuals it detained, and held individuals who did not meet the legal standard for
detention. The CIA's claims about the number of detainees held and subjected to its
enhanced Interrogation techniques were inaccurate.

The CIA never conducted a comprehensive audit or developed a complete and accurate list of the
individuals it had detained or subjected to its enhanced interrogation techniques. CIA statements
to the Committee and later to the public that the CIA detained fewer than 100 individuals, and

that less than a third of those 100 detainees were subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques, were inaccurate. The Committee's review of CIA records determined that the CIA

detained at least 119 individuals, of whom at least 39 were subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques.
Of the 119 known detainees, at least 26 were wrongfully held and did not meet the detention
standard in the September 2001 Memorandum of Notification (MON). These included an
"intellectually challenged" man whose CIA detention was used solely as leverage to get a family
member to provide information, two individuals who were intelligence sources for foreign
liaison services and were former CIA sources, and two individuals whom the CIA assessed to be

connected to al-Qa'ida based solely on information fabricated by a CIA detainee subjected to the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. Detainees often remained in custody for months after
the CIA determined that they did not meet the MON standard. CIA records provide insufficient
information to justify the detention of many other detainees.

TOP

Page 12 of 19
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

CIA Headquarters instructed that at least four CIA detainees be placed in host country detention
facilities because the individuals did not meet the MON standard for CIA detention. The host

country had no independent reason to hold the detainees.

A full accounting of CIA detentions and interrogations may be impossible, as records in some
cases are non-existent, and, in many other cases, are spai'se and insufficient. There were almost
no detailed records of the detentions and interrogations at the CIA's COBALT detention facility
in 2002, and almost no such records for the CIA's GRAY detention site, also in Country

At

CIA detention facilities outside of Country
the CIA kept increasingly less-detailed records of
its interrogation activities over the course of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.

#16: The CIA failed to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of its enhanced interrogation
techniques.

The CIA never conducted a credible, comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of its enhanced
interrogation techniques, despite a recommendation by the CIA inspector general and similar
requests by the national security advisor and the leadership of the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence.
Internal assessments of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program were conducted by CIA
personnel who participated in the development and management of the program, as well as by
CIA contractors who had a financial interest in its continuation and expansion. An "informal
operational assessment" of the program, led by two senior CIA officers who were not part of the
CIA's Counterterrorism Center, determined that it would not be possible to assess the
effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques without violating "Federal Policy
for the Protection of Human Subjects" regarding human experimentation. The CIA officers,
whose review relied on briefings with CIA officers and contractors running the program,
concluded only that the "CIA Detainee Program" was a "success" without addressing the

effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.^^
In 2005, in response to the recommendation by the inspector general for a review of the
effectiveness of each of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, the CIA asked two
individuals not employed by the CIA to conduct a broader review of "the entirety of the

"rendition, detention and interrogation program."^"^ According to one individual, the review was
"heavily reliant on the willingness of [CIA CounterteiTorism Center] staff to provide us with the
factual material that forms the basis of our conclusions." That individual acknowledged lacking
the requisite expertise to review the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques, and concluded only that "the program," meaning all CIA detainee reporting
regardless of whether it was connected to the use of the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation

techniques, was a "great success."^'' The second reviewer concluded that "there is no objective
way to answer the question of efficacy" of the techniques.
There are no CIA records to indicate that any of the reviews independently validated the
"effectiveness" claims presented by the CIA, to include basic confirmation that the intelligence
cited by the CIA was acquired from CIA detainees during or after the use of the CIA's enhanced

Page 13 of 19

UNCLASSIFIED
111!

II III I

interrogation techniques. Nor did the reviews seek to confirm whether the intelligence cited by
the CIA as being obtained "as a result" of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was
unique and "otherwise unavailable," as claimed by the CIA, and not previously obtainedfrom
other sources.

#17: The CIA rarely reprimanded or held personnel accountable for serious and
significant violations, inappropriate activities, and systemic and individual management
failures.

CIA officers and CIA contractors who were found to have violated CIA policies or performed
poorly were rarely held accountable or removed from positions of responsibility.
Significant events, to include the death and injury of CIA detainees, the detention of individuals
who did not meet the legal standard to be held, the use of unauthorized interrogation techniques
against CIA detainees, and the provision of inaccurate information on the CIA program did not
result in appropriate, effective, or in many eases, any corrective actions. CIA managers who
were aware of failings and shortcomings in the program but did not intervene, or who failed to
provide proper leadership and management, were also not held to account.

On two occasions in which the CIA inspector general identified wrongdoing, accountability
recommendations were ovennled by senior CIA leadership. In one instance, involving the death
of a CIA detainee at COBALT, CIA Headquarters decided not to take disciplinary action against
an officer involved because, at the time, CIA Headquarters had been "motivated to extract any

and all operational information" from the detainee.^^ In another instance related to a wrongful
detention, no action was taken against a CIA officer because, "[t]he Director strongly believes
that mistakes should be expected in a business filled with uncertainty," and "the Director
believes the scale tips decisively in favor of accepting mistakes that over connect the dots against

those thatunder connect them."^^ In neither case was administrative action taken against CIA
management personnel.

#18: The CIA marginalized and ignored numerous internal critiques, criticisms, and
objections concerning the operation and management of the CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program.

Critiques, criticisms, and objections were expressed by numerous CIA officers, including senior
personnel overseeing and managing the program, as well as analysts, interrogators, and medical
officers involved in or supporting CIA detention and interrogation operations.
Examples of these concerns include CIA officers questioning the effectiveness of the CIA's

enhanced interrogation techniques, interrogators disagreeing with the use of such techniques
against detainees whom they determined were not withholding information, psychologists
recommending less isolated conditions, and Office of Medical Services personnel questioning
both the effectiveness and safety of the techniques. These concerns were regularly overridden by
CIA management, and the CIA made few corrective changes to its policies governing the
1(11 'iM III I

(HIN

UNCLASSIFIED

program. At times, CIA officers were instructed by supervisors not to put their concerns or
observations in written communications.

In several instances, CIA officers identified inaccuracies in CIA representations about the

program and its effectiveness to the Office of Inspector General, the White House, the
Department of Justice, the Congress, and the American public. The CIA nonetheless failed to
take action to correct these representations, and allowed inaccurate information to remain as the
CIA's official position.
The CIA was also resistant to, and highly critical of more formal critiques. The deputy director
for operations stated that the CIA inspector general's draft Special Review should have come to

the "conclusion that our efforts have thwarted attacks and saved lives,"^^ while the CIA general
counsel accused the inspector general of presenting "an imbalanced and inaccurate picmre" of

the program.'^^ A February 2007 report from the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), which the CIA acting general counsel initially stated "actually does not sound that far
removed from the realitywas also criticized. CIA officers prepared documents indicating
that "critical portions of the Report are patently false or misleading, especially certain key factual
claims..CIA Director Hayden testified to the Committee that "numerous false allegations of
physical and threatened abuse and faulty legal assumptions and analysis in the [ICRC] report

undermine its overall credibility.'"^^
#19; The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program was inherently unsustainable and
had effectively ended by 2006 due to unauthorized press disclosures, reduced cooperation
from other nations, and legal and oversight concerns.

The CIA required secrecy and cooperation from other nations in order to operate clandestine
detention facilities, and both had eroded significantly before President Bush publicly disclosed
the program on September 6, 2006. From the beginning of the program, the CIA faced
significant challenges in finding nations willing to host CIA clandestine detention sites. These
challenges became increasingly difficult over time. With the exception of Country
the CIA
was forced to relocate detainees out of every country in which it established a detention facility
because of pressure from the host government or public revelations about the program.
Beginning in early 2005, the CIA sought unsuccessfully to convince the U.S. Department of
Defense to allow the transfer of numerous CIA detainees to U.S. military custody. By 2006, the
CIA admitted in its own talking points for CIA Director Porter Goss that, absent an
Administration decision on an "endgame" for detainees, the CIA was "stymied" and "the

program could collapse of its own weight.""^
Lack of access to adequate medical care for detainees in countries hosting the CIA's detention
facilities caused recunring problems. The refusal of one host country to admit a severely ill
detainee into a local hospital due to security concerns contributed to the closing of the CIA's
detention facility in that country. The U.S. Department of Defense also declined to provide
medical care to detainees upon CIA request.

Page 15 of 19

1(11 III ( III I

In mid-2003, a statement by the president for the United Nations International Day in Support of
Victims of Torture and a pubHc statement by the White House thatprisoners in U.S. custody are
treated "humanely" caused the CIA to question whether there was continued policy support for
the program and seek reauthorization from the White House. In mid-2004, the CIA temporarily
suspended the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques after the CIA inspector general
recommended that the CIA seek an updated legal opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel. In
early 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court decision to grant certiorari in the case of Rasul v. Bush
prompted the CIA to move detainees out of a CIA detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
In late 2005 and in 2006, the Detainee Treatment Act and then the U.S. Supreme Couit decision
in Hamdan v. Rumsfeldcaused the CIA to again temporarily suspend the use of its enhanced
interrogation techniques.

By 2006, press disclosures, the unwillingness of other countries to host existing or new detention
sites, and legal and oversight concerns had largely ended the CIA's ability to operate clandestine
detention facilities.

After detaining at least 113 individuals through 2004, the CIA brought only six additional
detainees into its custody: four in 2005, one in 2006, and one in 2007. By March 2006, the
program was operating in only one country. The CIA last used its enhanced interrogation
techniques on November 8, 2007. The CIA did not hold any detainees after April 2008.

#20; The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program damaged the United States'
standing in the world, and resulted in other significant monetary and non-monetary costs.
The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Pi-ogram created tensions with U.S. partners and allies,
leading to formal demarches to the United States, and damaging and complicating bilateral
inteUigence relationships.

In one example, inJune 2004, the secretary ofstate ordered the U.S. ambassador inCountry | to

deliver ademarche to CounteyB/li^ssence demanding [Country | Government] provide full

access to all [Country |
detainees" to the International Committee ofthe Red
Cross. At the time, however, the detainees Country | was holding included detainees being held
in secret at the CIA's behest."^^

More broadly, the program caused immeasurable damage to the United States' public standing,
as well as to the United States' longstanding global leadership on human rights in general and the
prevention of torture in particular.

CIA records indicate that the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program cost well over $300
million in non-personnel costs. This included funding for the CIA to construct and maintain

detention facilities, including two facilities costing nearly $| million that were never used, in
part due to host country political concerns.

To encourage governments to clandestinely host CIA detention sites, or to increase support for
existing sites, the CIA provided millions of dollars in cash payments to foreign government

DIRECTOR â¢â¢

(152227Z MAR 07)

The Committee's conclusion is basedon CIA records, including statements from CIA DirectorsGeorge Tenet and
PorterGoss to the CIA inspector general, that the directors had not briefed the president on the CIA's interrogation
program. According to CIA records, when briefed in April 2006, the president expressed discomfort with the
"image of a detainee, chained to the ceiling, clothed in a diaper, and forced to go to the bathroom on himself." The

CIA's June 2013 Response does not dispute the CIA records, but states that "[w]hile Agencyrecords on the subject
are admittedly incomplete, fonner President Bushhas stated in his autobiography that he discussed the program,
including the use of enhanced techniques, withthen-DCIA Tenetin 2002, prior to application of the techniques on
Abu Zubaydah, and personally approved tlie techniques." A memoir by fonner Acting CIA General Counsel John
Rizzo disputes this account.

Background on the Committee Study

(U) On December 11, 2007, the Senate Select Committeeon Intelligence ("the Committee")
initiated a review of the destruction of videotapes related to the interrogations of CIA detainees
Abu Zubaydah and 'Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri after receiving a briefing that day on the matter by
CIA Director Michael Hayden. At that briefing, Director Hayden stated that contemporaneous
CIA operational cables were "a more than adequate representation of the tapes," and he agreed to
provide the Committee with limited access to these cables at CIA Headquarters.
(U) On February 11, 2009, after the Committee was presented with a staff-prepared summary of
the operational cables detailing the interrogations of Abu Zubaydah and al-Nashiri, the
Committee began considering a broader review of the CIA's detention and interrogation
practices. On March 5, 2009, in a vote of 14 to 1, the Committee approved Terms of Reference
for a study of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.^
(U) The Committee Study of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program is a lengthy, higlily
detailed report exceeding 6,700 pages, including approximately 38,000 footnotes. It is divided
into three volumes;

I.

History and Operation of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. This
volume is divided chronologically into sections addressing the establishment,
development, and evolution of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. It
includes an addendum on CIA Clandestine Detention Sites and the Arrangements Made
with Foreign Entities in Relation to the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.

II.

Intelligence Acquired and CIA Representations on the Effectiveness of the CIA's
Enhanced Interrogation Techniques. This volume addresses the intelligence the CIA

attributed to CIA detainees and the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques,
specifically focusing on CIA representations regarding the effectiveness of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques, as well as how the CIA's Detention and Interrogation
Program was operated and managed. It includes sections on CIA representations to the
media, the Department of Justice, and the Congress.
ni.

Detention and Interrogation of CIA Detainees. This volume addresses the detention

and interrogation of 119 CIA detainees, from the program's authorization on September
17, 2001, to its official end on January 22, 2009, to include information on their capture,
detention, interrogation, and conditions of confinement. It also includes extensive

information on the CIA's management, oversight, and day-to-day operation of its
Detention and Interrogation Program.

(U) On December 13, 2012, the Senate Select Committee on InteUigence approved the
Committee Study of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program ("Committee Study") by a
bipartisan vote of 9-6. The Committee Study included 20 findings and conclusions. The
' See Appendix 1: "Terms of Reference, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Study of the Central Intelligence
Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program."

Committee requested that specific executive branch agencies review and provide comment on
the Committee Study prior to Committee action to seek declassification and public release of the
Committee Study. On June 27, 2013, the CIA provided a written response, which was followed
by a series of meetings between the CIA and the Committee that concluded in September 2013.
Following these meetings and the receipt of Minority views, the Committee revised the findings
and conclusions and updated the Committee Study. On April 3, 2014, by a bipartisan vote of 113, the Committee agreed to send the revised findings and conclusions, and the updated Executive
Summary of the Committee Study, to the president for declassification and public release.

(U) The Committee's Study is the most comprehensive review ever conducted of the CIA's
Detention and Interrogation Program. The CIA has informed the Committee that it has provided

the Committee with all CIA records related to the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.^
The document production phase lasted more than three years, produced more than six million
pages of material, and was completed in July 2012. The Committee Study is based primarily on
a review of these documents,^ which include CIA operational cables, reports, memoranda,
intelligence products, and numerous interviews conducted of CIA personnel by various entities
within the CIA, in particular the CIA's Office of Inspector General and the CIA's Oral History

Program, as well as internal email"^ and other communications.^
(U) The Executive Summary is divided into two pai'ts. The first describes the establishment,
development, operation, and evolution of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. The
second part provides information on the effectiveness of the CIA's Detention and InteiTogation
Program, to include information acquired from CIA detainees, before, during, and after the use
of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques; as well as CIA representations on the
effectiveness and operation of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program to the media, the
Department of Justice, and the Congress. The Executive Summary does not include a
^ The Committee did not have access to approximately 9,400 CIA documents related to the CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program that were withheld by the White House pending a determination and claim of executive

privilege. The Committee requested access to these documentsover several years, including in writing on January
3, 2013, May 22, 2013, and December 19,2013. The Committee received no response from the White House.
^ From January 2, 2008, to August 30, 2012, the Department of Justice conducted a separate investigation into
various aspects of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, witli tlie possibility of criminal prosecutions of
CIA personnel and contractors. On October 9, 2009, the CIA informed the Committee that it would not compel CIA
personnel to participate in interviews with the Committee due to concerns related to the pending Department of
Justice investigations. (See DTS #2009-4064.) While the Committee did not conduct interviews with CIA
personnel during the course of this review, the Committee utilized previous interview reports of CIA personnel and
CIA contractors conducted by tlie CIA's Office of the Inspector General and the CIA's Oral History Program. In
addition to CIA materials, the Committee reviewed a much smaller quantity of documents from the Department of
Justice, the Department of Defense, and the Department of State, as well as documents that had separately been
provided to the Committee outside of this review. Inconsistent spellings found within the Committee Study reflect
the inconsistencies found in the underlying documents reviewed.
The CIA informed tiie Committee that due to CIA record retention policies, the CIA could not produce all CIA

email communications requested by the Committee. As a result, in a few cases, the text of an email cited in the
Study was not available in its original format, but was embedded in a larger email chain. For tliis reason, the
Committee, in some limited cases, cites to an email chain that contains the original email, ratlier than the original
email itself.

The report does not review CIA renditions for individuals who were not ultimately detained by tlie CIA, CIA
interrogation of detainees in U.S. military custody, or tlie treatment of detainees in the custody of foreign
governments, as these topics were not included in the Committee's Terms of Reference.

listed by pseudonym. The pseudonyms for these officers are used throughout the report. To
distinguish CIA officers in pseudonym from those in true name, pseudonyms in this report are
denoted by last names in upper case letters. Additionally, the CIA requested that the names of
countries that hosted CIAdetention sites, or with which the CIA negotiated the hosting of sites,
as well as information directly or indirectly identifying such countries, be redacted from the
classified version provided to Committee members. The report therefore lists these countries by
letter. The report uses the same designations consistently, so "Country J," for example, refers to
the same country throughout the Committee Study. Further, the CIA requested that the
Committee replace the original code names for CIA detention sites with new identifiers.^

^On April 7,2014, the Executive Summary ofthe Committee Study ofthe CIA's Detention and Interrogation
Program wasprovided to theexecutive branch fordeclassification andpublic release. On August 1,2014, theCIA
returned to the Committee the Executive Summary with its proposed redactions. Overthe ensuing months, the
Committee engaged in deliberations with the CIA and the White House to ensure that the Committee's narrativeâ

andsupport for the Committee's findings andconclusionsâremained intact. Significant alterations havebeen made
to the Executive Summary in order to reach agreement on a publicly releasable versionof the document. For
example, theCIA requested that in select passages, the Committee replace specific dates with more general time
frames. The Committee also replaced the true names of some senior non-undercover CIA officials with
pseudonyms. The executive branchthen redacted all pseudonyms for CIA personnel,and in some cases the titles of

positions held by theCIA personnel. Further, while the classified Executive Summaiy and full Committee Study
lists specific countries by letter (for example "Country J"), and uses thesame letter to designate the specific country

throughout the Committee Study, the letter^iav^eei^edacte^^ieexecuti^ branch for this public release.

Overall History and Operation of the CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program

A. September 17, 2001, Memorandum of Notification (MON) Authorizes the CIA to
Capture and Detain a Specific Category of Individuals

U.S. Military Base Is the "Best Option": the CIA Delegates "Blanket" Detention
Approvals to CIA Ojficers in

September 17, 2001, six days after the teiTorist attacks of
September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush signed a covert action Memorandum of
Notification (MON) to authorize the director of central intelligence (DCI) to "undertake

operations designed to capture and detain persons who pose a continuing, serious threat of

violence or death to U.S. persons and interests or who are planning terrorist activities."^
Although the CIA had previously been provided limited authorities to detain specific, named
individuals pending the issuance of formal criminal charges, the MON provided unprecedented
authorities, granting the CIA significant discretion in determining whom to detain, the factual

basis for the detention, and the length of the detention.^ The MON made no reference to
interrogations or interrogation techniques.^

On Septemberl4^00Mhrcj days before the issuance ofthe
MON, the chief ofoperations ofthe CIA's
based on an urgent requh^ent from
the chief ofthe Counterterrorism Center (CTC), sent an email to CIA Stations in HI seeking
input on appropriate locations for potential CIA detention facilities.

Over the courseoftiie

next month, CIA officers considered at least four countries in |||||||||| and one in HHHB as
possible hosts for detention facilities and

at least three proposed sitelocations. ^^

email stated that covert facilities would be operated "in a manner consistent with, but not
pursuant to, the formal provision of appropriately comparable Federal instructions for the

operation of prison facilitie^n^he incarceration of inmates held under the maximum lawful
security mechanisms." I^H^I's email recognized the CIA's lack ofexperience in nmning
detention facilities, and stated that the CIA would consider acquiring cleared personnel from the
Department of Defense or the Bureau of Prisons with specialized expertise to assist the CIA in
operating the facilities.On September27, 2001, CIA Headquarters informed CIA Stations that
any future CIA detention facility would have to meet "U.S. POW Standards.
early November 2001, CIA Headquarters further determined
that any future CIA detention facility would have to meet U.S. prison standards and that CIA
detention and interrogation operations should be tailored to "meet the requirements of U.S. law
and the federal rules of criminalprocedure," adding that "[s]pecific methods of interrogation
w[ould] be permissible so long as they generally comport with commonly accepted practices
deemed lawful by U.S. courts.The CIA's search for detention site locations was then put on
hold and an internal memorandum from senior CIA officials explained that detention at a U.S.
military base outside of the United States was the "best option."'^ The memorandum thus urged
the DCI to "[pjress DOD and the US military, at highest levels, to have the US Military agree to
host a long-term facility, and have them identify an agreeable location," specifically requesting
that the DCI "[s]eek to have the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay designated as a long-term
detention facility.

Addressing the risks associated with the CIA maintaining a

detention facility, the CIA memorandum warned that "[a]s captured terrorists may be held days,
months, or years, the likelihood of exposure will grow over time," and that "[m]edia exposure
could inflame public opinion against a host government and the U.S., thereby threatening the
continued operation of the facility." The memorandum also anticipated that, "[i]n a foreign
country, close cooperation with the host government will entail intensive negotiations."^^ The
CIA memorandum warned that "any foreign country poses uncontrollable risks that could create

incidents, vulnerability to the security of the facility, bilateral problems, and uncertainty over
maintaining the facility."^^ The memorandum recommended the establishment of a "short-term"
facility in which the CIA's role would be limited to "oversight, funding and responsibility." The

CIA would "contract out all other requirements to other US Government organizations,

commercial companies, and, as appropriate, foreign governments."'^
October 8, 2001, DCI George Tenet delegated the management

and oversight of the capture and detention authorities provided by the MON to the CIA's deputy
director for operations (DDO), James Pavitt, and the CIA's chief of the Counterterrorism Center,
Cofer Black.^^ The DCI also directed that all requests and approvals for capture and detention be

documented in writing. On December 17, 2001, however, the DDO rescinded these^^^^

requirements and issued via aCIA cable "blanket approval" for CIA officers in jHHH to
"determine [who poses] the requisite 'continuing serious threat of violence or death to US

persons and interests orwho are planning terrorist activities.'"^' By March 2002, CIA
Headquarters had expanded the authority beyond the language of the MON and instructed CIA
personnel that it would be appropriate to detain individuals who might not be high-value targets
in their own right, but could provide information on high-value targets.

On April 7, 2003, ^^IHCTC Legal,
sent a cable to CIA Stations and Bases stating that "at this stage in the war [we] believe there is
sufficient opportunity in advance to document the key aspects of many, if not most, of our

capture and detain operations.cable also provided guidance as to who could
be detained under the MON, stating:
"there must be an articulable basis on which to conclude that the actions of a

specific person whom we propose to capture and/or detain pose a 'continuing
serious threat' of violence or death to U.S. persons or interests or that the person
is planning a terrorist activity.

.. .We are not permitted to detain someone merely upon a suspicion that he or
she has valuable information about teiTorists or planned acts of ten'orism....
Similarly, the mere membership in a particular group, or the mere existence of a
particular familial tie, does not ncccssarily connote that the threshold of

'continuing, serious threat' has been satisfied."^"^

2. The CIA Holds at Least 21 More Detainees Than It Has Represented; At Least 26 CIA
Detainees Wrongly Detained

While the CIA has represented in public and classified settings that
it detained "fewer than one hundred" individuals,-^ the Committee's review of CIA records
indicates that the total number of CIA detainees was at least 119.^^ Internal CIA documents

indicate that inadequate record keeping made it impossible for the CIA to determine how many
individuals it had detained. In December2003, a CIA Station overseeing CIA detention

operations in Country | informed CIA Headquarters that ithad made the "unsettling discovery"
that the CIA was "holding a number of detainees about whom" it knew "very little,"^^ Nearly
five years later, in late 2008, the CIA attempted to determine how many individuals the CIA had
detained. At the completion of the review, CIA leaders, including CIA Director Michael
Hayden, were informed that the review found that the CIA had detained at least 112 individuals,

and possibly more.^^ According to an email summarizing the meeting, CIA Director Hayden
CIA Director Hayden typicallydescribed the program as holding "fewer than a hundred" detainees. For example,
in testimony before the Committee on February 4, 2008, in response to a question from Chairman Rockefeller
during an open hearing, Hayden stated, "[i]n the life of the CIA detention program we have held fewer than a
hundred people." {See DTS #2008-1140.) Specific references to "98" detainees were included in a May 5, 2006,
House Permanent Select Committee on IntelUgence (HPSCI)report on Renditions, Detentions and Interrogations.
See also Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel, Central IntelligenceAgency, from Steven G.
Bradbury, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Officeof LegalCounsel, July 20, 2007, Re: Application of

The Committee's accountingof the numberof CIA detainees is conservative and only includes individuals for
whom there is clear evidence of detention in CIA custody. The Committee thus did not count, among the 119

detainee^ix ofthe 31 individuals listed in amemo entitled "Updated List of Detainees In |

As of June 27, 2013, when the CIA provided its Response to the Committee Study of tlie CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program (hereinafter, the "CIA's June 2013 Response"), the CIA had not yet made an independent
determination of the number of individuals it had detained. The CIA's June 2013 Response does not address the
numberof detainees determined by the Committee to be held by the CIA, other than to assert that the discrepancy
between past CIA representations, that there were fewer than 100 detainees, and the Committee's determination of

there being at least 119 CIA detainees, was not "substantively meaningful." The CIA's June 2013 Response states
that the discrepancy "does not impact the previously known scale of the program," and that "[i]t remains true that

approximately 100 detainees were pjirt of the program; not 10 and not 200." The CIA's June 2013 Response also
states that, "[t]he Studyleaves unarticulated what impactthe relatively small discrepancy might have had on
policymakers or Congressional overseers." The CIA's June 2013 Response further asserts that, at the time Director
Hayden was representing there had been fewer than 100 detainees (2007-2009), the CIA's internal research

instructed a CIA officer to devise a way to keep the number of CIA detainees at the same number

the CIA had previously briefed to Congress. The email, which the briefer sent only to himself,
stated:

"I briefed the additional CIA detainees that could be included in RDI"^
numbers. DCIA instructed me to keep the detainee number at 98 ~ pick

whatever date i [sic] needed to make that happen but the number is 98."^^
While the CIA acknowledged to the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) in February 2006 that it had wrongly detained five
individuals throughout the course of its detention program, a review of CIA records indicates

"indicate[d] the total number of detainees could have been as high as 112," and that "uncertainty existed within CIA

about whether a group of additional detainees were actually part of the program, partially because some of tliem had
passed tlirough [DETENTION SITE COBALT] prior to the formal establishment of tlie program under CTC
auspices on 3 December 2002" (emphasis added). This June 27, 2013, CIA statement is inaccurate: the CIA's
determination at the time was that there had been at least 112 CIA detainees and that the inclusion of detainees held

prior to December 3, 2002, would make that number higher. On December20, 2008, a CTC officer informed the
chief of CTC that "112 were detained by CIA since September 11, 2001," noting "[t]hese revised statistics do not
include any detainees at [DETENTION SITE COBALT] (other than Gul Rahman) who departed [DETENTION

SITE COBA^Jprior to RDG assuming authority of[DETENTION SITE COBALT] as of03 Deceiver 2002."

Revised Rendition and Detention

Statistics; date: December 20, 2008.) By December 23, 2008, CTC had created a giaph that identified the total
number of CIA detainees, excluding Gul Rahman, "Post 12/3/02" as 111. The graph identified the total number
including Gul Rahman, but excluding otlier detainees "pre-12/3/02" as "112+ ?." (See CIA-produced PowerPoint
Slide, RDG Numbers, dated December 23, 2008.) Witli regard to the Committee's inclusion of detainees held at
DETENTION SITE COBALT prior to December 3, 2002, the CIA does not dispute that they were held by the CIA
pursuant to the same MON authorities as detainees held after that date. Moreover, the CIA has regularly counted
among its detainees a number of individuals who were held solely at DETENTIONSITECOB ALT prior to

December 3,2002, as well as several who were held exclusively at Country ^^^m||m|p:'acilities on behalf of
the CIA. In discussing the role of DETENTION SITE COBALT in the CIA's Detention and Intenogation Program,

tlien Deputy Director of Operations James Pavitt told the CIA Office of Inspector General in August 2003 that
"there are those who say that [DETENTION SITE COBALT] is not a CIA facility, but that is 'bullshit.'" (See

psychological techniques are counterproductive because they do not produce intelligence and

will probably result in false answers."^^ Testimony of the CIA deputy director of operations in
1988 denounced coercive interrogation techniques, stating, "[pjhysical abuse or other degrading
treatment was rejected not only becauseit is wrong, but because it has historically proven to be

ineffective."^^ By October 2001, CIA policy was to comply with the Department of the Army
Field Manual "Intelligence Interrogation."^^ A CIA Directorate of Operations Handbook from
October 2001 states that the CIA does not engage in "human rights violations," which it defined
as: "Torture, cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment, or prolonged detention without
charges or trial." The handbook further stated that "[i]t is CIA policy to neither participate
directly in nor encourage interrogation which involves the use of force, mental or physical
torture, extremely demeaning indignities or exposure to inhumane treatment of any kind as an
aid to interrogation."^^
(U) The CIA did, however, have historical experience using coercive forms of interrogation. In
1963, the CIA produced the KUBARK Counterintelligence InteiTogation Manual, intended as a
manual for Cold War inteiTogations, which included the "principal coercive techniques of
interrogation: arrest, detention, deprivation of sensory stimuli through solitary confinement or
similar methods, threats and fear, debility, pain, heightened suggestibility and hypnosis, narcosis
and induced regression."'^Â® In 1978, DCIStansfield Turner asked former CIA officer John
Limond Hart to investigate the CIA interrogation of Soviet KGB officer Yuri Nosenko"^^ using
the KUBARK methodsâto include sensory deprivation techniques and forced standing."^^ In
Hart's testimony before the House Select Committee on Assassinations on September 15, 1978,
he noted that in his 31 years of government service:

"It has never fallen to my lot to be involved with any experience as unpleasant
in every possible way as, first, the investigation of this case, and, second, the
necessity of lecturing upon it and testifying. To me it is an abomination, and I

According to public records, in the mid-1960s, the CIA imprisoned and interrogated Yuri Nosenko, a Soviet KGB
officer who defected to the U.S. in early 1964,for three years (April 1964 to September 1967). Senior CIA officers
at the time did not believe Nosenko was an actual defectorand orderedhis imprisonment and interrogation.
Nosenko was confined in a specially constructed "jail," with nothing but a cot, and was subjected to a series of
sensory deprivation techniques and forced standing.

Notwithstanding the Hart investigation findings, just five years
later, in 1983, a CIA officer incorporated significant portions of the KUBARK manual into the
Human Resource Exploitation (HRE) Training Manual, which the same officer used to provide

interrogation training in Latin America in the early 1980s, and which was used to mjovid^^^^
interrogation training to the

methods of interrogation w[ould] be permissible so long as they generally comport with

commonly accepted practices deemed lawful by U.S. courts,"^^ by the end of November 2001,
CIA officers had begun researching potential legal defenses for using interrogation techniques
that were considered torture by foreign governments and a non-governmental organization. On
November 26, 2001, attorneys in the CIA's Office of General Counsel circulated a draft legal
memorandum describing the criminal prohibition on torture and a potential "novel" legal defense
for CIA officers who engaged in torture. The memorandum stated that the "CIA could argue that
the torture was necessary to prevent imminent, significant, physical harm to persons, where there
is no other available means to prevent the harm," adding that "states may be very unwilling to

call the U.S. to task for torture when it resulted in saving thousands of lives,"^^ An August 1,

2002, OLC memorandum to the White House Counsel includes a similar analysis of the
"necessity defense" in response to potential charges of torture.^^
January 2002, the National Security Council principals began to
debate whether to apply the protections of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of
Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949 ("Geneva") to the conflict with al-Qa'ida and the Taliban.

A letter drafted for DCI Tenet to the president urged that the CIA be exempt from any
application of these protections, arguing that application of Geneva would "significantly hamper
the ability of CIA to obtain critical threatinformation necessary to save American lives."^^ On
February 1, 2002âapproximately two months prior to the detention of the CIA's first detaineeâ
a CIA attorney wrote that if CIA detainees were covered by Geneva there would be "few
alternatives to simply asking questions." The attorney concluded that, if that were the case,
"then the optic becomes how legally defensible is a particular act that probably violates the
convention, but ultimately saves lives.

On February 7, 2002, President Bush issued a memorandum stating
that neither al-Qa'ida nor Taliban detainees qualified as prisoners of war under Geneva, and that
Common Article 3 of Geneva, requiring humane treatment of individuals in a conflict, did not
apply to al-Qa'ida or Taliban detainees.^^
From the issuance of the MON to early 2002, there are no

indications in CIA records that the CIA conducted significant research to identify effective
interrogation practices, such as conferring with experienced U.S. military or law enforcement
interrogators, or with the intelligence, military, or law enforcement services of other countries
with experience in counterten-orism and the interrogation of terrorist suspects.Nor are there
CIA records referencing any review of the CIA's past use of coercive interrogation techniques
and associated lessons learned. The only research documented in CIA records during this time
on the issue of interrogation was the preparation of a report on an al-Qa'ida manual that was

18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2340-2340A. Like the November 26, 2001, draft memo, the OLC memorandum addressed the Israeh
example.

initially assessed by the CIA to include strategies to resist interrogation. This report was
commissioned by the CIA's Office of Technical Services (OTS) and drafted by two CIA

contractors, Dr. Grayson SWIGERT and Dr. Hammond DUNBAR.^^
Both SWIGERT and DUNBAR had been psychologists with the
U.S. Air Force Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) school, which exposes select

U.S. military personnel to, among other things, coercive interrogation techniques that they might
be subjected to if taken prisoner by countries that did not adhere to Geneva protections. Neither
psychologist had experience as an interrogator, nor did either have specialized knowledge of alQa'ida, a background in terrorism, or any relevant regional, cultural, or linguistic expertise.
SWIGERT had reviewed research on "learned helplessness," in which individuals might become

passive and depressed in response to adverse or uncontrollable events.^^ He theorized that
inducing such a state could encourage a detainee to cooperate and provide information.^^
2. The CIA Renders Abu Zubaydah to a Covert Facility, Obtains Presidential Approval
Without Inter-Agency Deliberation
March 2002, Pakistani government authorities, working
with the CIA, captured al-Qa'ida facilitator Abu Zubaydah in a raid during which Abu Zubaydah
suffered bullet wounds. At that time, Abu Zubaydah was assessed by CIA officers in ALEC
Station, the office within the CIA with specific responsibility for al-Qa'ida, to possess detailed

knowledge of al-Qa'ida terrorist attack plans. However, as is described in greater detail in the
full Committee Study, this assessment significantly overstated Abu Zubaydah's role in al-Qa'ida

and the information he was likely to possess.^Â®

infrastructure independent of 'Abdullah Azzam's Maktab al-Kliidamat, the nongovernmental organization that
supported Khaldan. Al-Qa'ida rejected Abu Zubaydah's request in 1993 to join the group and Khaldan was not
overseen by bin Laden's organization. There were relations between the al-Qa'ida camps and Klialdan. Trainees,

listing, without

commentary, the restrictions on interrogation in the Geneva Conventions, the Convention

Against Torture, and the criminal prohibition on torture.^March 2002, anticipating its eventual custody of Abu
Zubaydah, the CIA began considering options for his transfer to CIA custody and detention

under the MON. The CIA rejected U.S. military custody ^H|||||||H, in large part because of
the lack of security and the fact that Abu Zubaydah would have to be declared to the

International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).^^ The CIA's concerns about custody at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, included the general lack of secrecy and the "possible loss of control to

US military and/or FBI."^"^ Rendition to Country | was rejected because ofthe perception that
the results of that country's recent interrogations had been disappointing, as well as the intense
interest in Abu Zubaydah from CIA leadership. As ALEC Station wrote, the CIA needed to
participate directly in the interrogation, "[n]ot because we believe necessarily we can improve on

[Country |] performance, but because the reasons for the lack of progress will be transparent
and reportable up die line."^^
Over the course of four days, the CIA settled on a detention site in

Country | because of that country's
and the lack of U.S. court jurisdiction. The only disadvantages identified by the CIA with

detention in Country | were that it would not be a "USG-controlled facility" and that
"diplomatic/policy decisions" would be required.^^ As a March 28, 2002, CIA document

acknowledged, the proposal to render Abu Zubaydah to Country | had not yet been broached
with that country's officials. The document also warned: "[w]e can't guarantee security. If AZ's

presence does become known, not clear what the impactwould be."^^
The decision to detain Abu Zubaydah at a covert detention facility

in Country | did not involve the input ofthe National Security Council Principals Committee,
the Department of State, the U.S. ambassador, or the CIA chief of Station in Country

Investigation (FBI) who spoke Arabic and had experience interrogating members of al-Qa'ida.
Abu Zubaydah confirmed his identity to the FBI officers, informed the FBI officers he wanted to
cooperate, and provided background information on his activities. That evening, Abu
Zubaydah's medical condition deteriorated rapidly and he required immediate hospitalization.
Although Abu Zubaydah was largely unable to communicate because of a breathing tube, he
continued to provide information to FBI and CIA officials at the hospital using an Arabic
alphabet chart. According to records, the FBI officers remained at Abu Zubaydah's bedside
du'oughout this ordeal and assisted in his medical care. When Abu Zubaydah's breathing tube
was removed on April 8, 2002, Abu Zubaydah provided additional intelligence and reiterated his

intention to cooperate.^^
During an April 10, 2002, debriefing session, conducted in the
hospital's intensive care unit, Abu Zubaydah revealed to the FBI officers that an individual
named "Mukhtar" was the al-Qa'ida "mastermind" of the 9/11 attacks. Abu Zubaydah identified
a picture of Mukhtar provided by the FBI from the FBI's Most Wanted list. The picture was of
Khalid Shaykh Mohammad (KSM), who had been indicted in 1996 for his role in Ramzi
Yousef's terrorist plotting to detonate explosives on 12 United States-flagged aircraft and destroy

them mid-flight over the Pacific Ocean.^^ Abu Zubaydah told the interrogators that "Mukhtar"
was related to Ramzi Yousef, whom Abu Zubaydah said was in an American jail (Yousef had
been convicted for the aforementioned terrorist plotting and was involved in the 1993 World

Trade Center terrorist attack).^^
Zubaydah told the FBI officers that "Mukhtar" trained the

9/11 hijackers and also provided additional information on KSM's background, to include diat
KSM spoke fluent English, was approximately 34 yeai*s old, and was responsible for al-Qa'ida

operations outside of Afghanistan.^^ Subsequent representations on the success of the CIA's
Detention and Interrogation Program consistently describe Abu Zubaydah's identification of
KSM's role in the September 11, 2001, attacks, as well as his identification of KSM's alias

("Mukhtar"), as being "important" and "vital" information.^'^ A review of CIA records found
that this information was corroborative of information already in CIA databases.^^

While Abu Zubaydah was still hospitalized, personnel at CIA

Headquarters began discussing how CIA officers would interrogate Abu Zubaydah upon his
return to DETENTION SITE GREEN. The initial CIA interrogation proposal recommended that
the interrogators engage with Abu Zubaydah to get him to provide information, and suggested

that a"hard approach," involving foreign gov^jjmen^ersonnel, be t^cei^|onlyasalaÂ£
resort."^^ At a meeting about this proposal, ^H^^hCTC Legal,
recommended that a psychologist working on contract in the CIA's Office of Technical Services
(OTS), Grayson SWIGERT, be used by CTC to "provide real-time recommendations to

overcome Abu Zubaydahl^^sistan^ to interrogation."^^ SWIGERT had come to
attention through
who worked in OTS. Shortly thereafter, CIA
Headquarters formally proposed that Abu Zubaydah be kept in an all-white room that was lit 24
hours a day, that Abu Zubaydah not be provided any amenities, that his sleep be disrupted, that
loud noise be constantly fed into his cell, and that only a small number of people interact with
him. CIA records indicate that these proposals were based on the idea that such conditions

would lead Abu Zubaydah to develop a sense of "learned helplessness."^"^ CIA Headquarters

then sent an interrogation team to Country |, including SWIGERT, whose initial role was to
consult on the psychological aspects of the interrogation.^^
DCI Tenet was provided an update on the Abu Zubaydah

interrogation plans on April 12, 2002. The update stated that the CIA team was preparing for
Abu Zubaydah's transfer back to DETENTION SITE GREEN, and noted the CIA interrogation
team intended to "set the stage" and increase control over Abu Zubaydah.^^ The update stated:
"Our [CIA] lead interrogator will require Abu Zubaydah to reveal the most
sensitive secret he knows we are seeking; if he dissembles or diverts the
conversation, the interview will stop and resume at a later time.... In

accordance with the strategy, and with concurrence from FBI Headquarters,
the two on-site FBI agents wiU no longer directly participate in the
interview/debriefing sessions."^^

The FBI special agents questioning Abu Zubaydah at the hospital
objected to the CIA's plans. In a message to FBI Headquarters, an FBI special agent wrote that
the CIA psychologists had acquired "tremendous influence.The message further stated:
"AZ's health has improved over the last two days and Agency[CIA]is ready

to move [Abu Zubaydah] out of the hospital and back toUH^^Ion
in an elaborate plan to change AZ's environment. Agency [CIA]
advised this day that they will be immediately changing tactics in all future AZ
interviews by having only there [sic] [CIA officer] interact with AZ (there will
be no FBI presence in interview room). This change contradicts all
conversations had to date.... They believe AZ is offering, 'throw away
information' and holding back from providing threat information (It should be
note [sic] that we have obtained critical information regarding AZ thus far and
have now got him speaking about threat information, albeit from his hospital
bed and not [an] appropriate interview environment for full follow-up (due to
his health). Suddenly the psychiatric team here wants AZ to only interact with
their [CIA officer, and the CIA sees this] as being the best way to get the threat
information.... We offered several compromise solutions... all suggestions
were immediately declined without further discussion. .. .This again is quite
odd as all information obtained from AZ has come from FBI lead interviewers

and questioning.... I have spent an un-calculable amount of hours at [Abu
Zubaydah's] bedside assisting with medical help, holding his hand and
comforting hum through various medical procedures, even assisting him in
going [to] the batliroom.... We have built tremendous report [sic] with AZ and
now that we are on the eve of 'regular'' interviews to get threat information, we
have been 'written out' of future interviews.

Temporarily Barredfrom the Questioning of Abu Zubaydah; Abu Zubaydah then Placed
in Isolation for 47 Days Without Questioning
On April 13, 2002, while Abu Zubaydah was still at the hospital,

the CIA implemented the "new interrogation program."^Â®" This initial meeting was held with
just one interrogator in the room and lasted 11 minutes. A cable stated that the CIA interrogator

was coached by the "psychological team."'^^ The CIA interrogator advised Abu Zubaydah that
he (Abu Zubaydah) "had a most important secret that [the interrogator] needed to know."
According to the cable, Abu Zubaydah "amazingly" nodded in agreement about the secret, but

"did not divulge any information, as [the interrogation team] expected."'^- A cable further
explained that Abu Zubaydah indicated that he understood that the key question was about
"impending future terrorist plans against the United States,"'^'' and that the CIA officer told Abu
Zubaydah to signal for him "when he decides to discuss that 'one key item he knows he is
keeping from the [interrogator]."'^^ The FBI officers provided a similar account to FBI
Headquarters, adding that: "We spent the rest of the day in the adjoining room with [the CIA
officer] and one of the psychiatrists [REDACTED] waiting for [Abu Zubaydah] to signal he was
ready to talk. [Abu Zubaydiili] apparcnt[y went to sleep... they did not approach [Abu
Zubaydah] the rest of the day."'"'' In their communications with FBI Headquarters, the FBI
officers wrote that they explained their rapport-building approaches to the CIA interrogation
team and "tried to explain that we have used this approach before on other Al-Qaeda members

with much success (al-Owhali,^"^ KKM, Jandal, Badawi etc.). We tried to politely suggest that
valuable time was passing where we could attempt to solicit threat information...."''^^
Ori April 15, 2002, per a scripted plan, the same CIA interrogator
delivered what a CIA cable described as "the pre-move message" to Abu Zubaydah; that "time is
mnning out," that his situation had changcd, and that the interrogator was disappointed that Abu

Zubaydah did not signal "to discuss the one thing he was hiding."^"Â®^ Abu Zubaydiih was sedated
and moved from the hospital to DETENTION SITE GREEN. When Abu Zubaydah awoke at
11:00 PM, four hours after his arrival, he was described as surprised and disturbed by his new
situation. An April 16, 2002, cable states the "objective is to ensure that [Abu Zubaydah] is at
his most vulnerable state."

a cable described Abu Zubaydah's cell as white with no natural

lighting or windows, but with four halogen lights pointed into the cell."" An air conditioner was
also in the room. A white curtain separated the interrogation room from the cell. The
interrogation cell had three padlocks. Abu Zubaydah was also provided with one of two chairs
that were rotated based on his level of cooperation (one described as more comfortable tlian the
other). Security officers wore all black uniforms, including boots, gloves, balaclavas, and
goggles to keep Abu Zubaydah from identifying the officers, as well as to prevent Abu Zubaydah

"from seeing the security guards as individuals who he may attempt to establish a relationship or

dialogue with.""' The security officers communicated by hand signals when they were with

rock music was played or noise generators were used to enhance Abu Zubaydah's "sense of

hopelessness."'^^ Abu Zubaydah was typically kept naked and sleep deprived.'
An April 16, 2002, cable explained that the interrogation strategy
had shifted since Abu Zubaydah's medical condition prevented "total isolation as originally
planned." According to the cable, a 24-hour interrogation strategy was now "deemed to be the
best approach" for acquiring information. As a result, the FBI officers were once again allowed

to question Abu Zubaydah.''"^ On April 17, 2002, an FBI officer met with Abu Zubaydah for six
hours.'FBI records state that Abu Zubaydah had "not seen the interviewing (FBI) agent" since

April 11, 2002, butthatAbu Zubaydah greeted the agent by name.''^ During the questioning
Abu Zubaydah denied any knowledge related to specific tai*gets for a pending attack and
"advised that many of the brothers on the front lines (nfi) [no further information] talked about
all types of attacks against America but that for the most part this was usually just talk and that

[the United States] should not be concerned about this type of talk,""^ Abu Zubaydah provided
information on al-Qa'ida, KSM, his past ti-avel to the United States, as well as general
information on extremists in Pakistan."^
Zubaydah continued to provide information to interrogators
thi'oughout April 2002, but not information on pending attacks against the United States. On the
evening of April 20, 2002, Abu Zubaydah told the FBI officers about two men who approached
him with a plan to detonate a uranium-based explosive device in the United States. Abu
Zubaydah stated he did not believe the plan was viable and did not know the names of the two

individuals, but provided physical descriptions of the pair.''^ This information was acquired
after Abu Zubaydah was confronted with emails indicating that he had sent the two individuals

to KSM.'^Â® The CIA would later represent that this information was acquired "as a result" of the
use of the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques, and that the information acquired resulted in

period also differed from how sleep deprivation was implemented after the Department of Justice approved the

deprivation, Abu Zubaydah was kept awake by being questioned nearly non-stop by CIA and FBI intenogators.

the thwarting of the "Dirty Bomb Plot" and the capture of Jose Padilla.^^^ However, the chief of
the Abu Zubaydah Task Force stated that "AZ's info alone would never have allowed us to find

them," while another CIA officer stated that the CIA was already "alert" to the threat posed by
Jose Padilla, and that the CIA's "suspicion" was only "enhanced during the debriefings of Abu

Zubaydah."^^^ Additional information on the "Dirty Bomb Plot" and the capture of Jose Padilla
is provided later in this summary.
During the month of April 2002, which included a period during
which Abu Zubaydah was hospitalized, on life support, and unable to speak, the CIA

disseminated 39 intelligence reports based on his interrogations.'^^ At the end of April 2002, the
DETENTION SITE GREEN interrogation team provided CIA Headquarters with three
interrogation strategies. CIA Headquarters chose the most coercive interrogation option, which

was proposed and supported by CIA contractor SWIGERT.^^"^ This coercive interrogation
optionâwhich included sensory deprivationâwas again opposed by the FBI special agents at

the detention site.'^^ The interrogation proposal was to engage in "only a single-minded,
consistent, totally focused questioning of currentthreat information." '^^ Once implemented, this
approach failed to produce the information CIA Headquarters believed Abu Zubaydah
possessed: threats to the United States and information about al-Qa'ida operatives located in the

United States. Nonetheless, Abu Zubaydah continued to provide other intelligence. In May
2002, the CIA disseminated 56 intelligence reports based on the interrogations.
In early June 2002, the CIA interrogation team recommended that

Abu Zubaydah spend several weeks in isolation while the interrogation team members departed
the facility "as a means of keeping [Abu Zubaydah] off-balance and to allow the team needed
time off for a break and to attend to personal matters

as well as to discuss "the

endgame" ofAbu Zubaydah jjjjHIH with officers from CIA Headquarters.'^^ As a result, from

asked any questions. Despite the fact that Abu Zubaydah was in isolation for nearly half of the
month, the CIA disseminated 37 intelligence reports based on the interrogations of Abu
Zubaydah in June 2002.
The CIA would later represent publiclyâas well as in classified
settingsâthat during the use of "established US Government interrogation techniques," Abu
Zubaydah "stopped all cooperation" in June 2002, requiring the development of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques.CIA records do not support this assertion.
Prior to Abu Zubaydah's 47-day isolation period, Abu Zubaydah

provided information on al-Qa'ida activities, plans, capabilities, and relationships, in addition to
information on its leadership structure, including personalities, decision-making processes,
training, and tactics.As described in more detail in the full Committee Study, Abu
Zubaydah's inability to provide information on the next attack in the United States and

operatives in the United States served as the basis for CIA representations that Abu Zubaydah
was "uncooperative," as well as for the CIA's determination that Abu Zubaydah required the use
of what would later be known as the CIA's "enhanced interrogation techniques" to become

"compliant" and reveal the information the CIA believed he was withholding. Abu Zubaydah
never provided this information, and CIA officers later concluded this was information Abu
Zubaydah did not possess.

comb previously collected intelligence for both names, opening up new leads to tliis tenorist plotterâleads that
eventually resulted in liis capture. It was clear to his intenogators tliat Abu Zubaydah possessed a great deal of
information about al-Qa'ida; however, he soon stopped all cooperation. Over the ensuing months, the CIA designed
a new interrogation program that would be safe, effective, and legal." See also CIA Director Michael Hayden,

In early July 2002, CIA officers held several meetings at CIA

Headquarters to discuss the possible use of "novel interrogation methods" on Abu Zubaydah.'^"^
During the course of those meetings SWIGERT proposed using techniques derived from the U.S.
military's SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape) school.SWIGERT provided a
list of 12 SERE techniques for possible use by the CIA: (1) the attention grasp, (2) walling, (3)
facial hold, (4) facial slap, (5) cramped confinement, (6) waU standing, (7) stress positions, (8)
sleep deprivation, (9) waterboard, (10) use of diapers, (11) use of insects, and (12) mock
burial.SWIGERT also recommended that the CIA enter into a contract with Hammond

DUNBAR, his co-author of the CIA report on potential al-Qa'ida interrogation resistance
training, to aid in the CIA interrogation process.Like SWIGERT, DUNBAR had never
participated in a real-world interrogation. His interrogation experience was limited to the paper
he authored with SWIGERT and his work with U.S. Air Force personnel at the SERE school.

For more information on the SEREprogram, see the Senate Armed Services Committee Inquiryinto the
Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody, December2008. See also statement of Senator Carl Levin on the inquiry,
December 11, 2008; "SERE training is intended to be used to teach our soldiers how to resist interrogation by
enemies that refuse to follow the Geneva Conventions and international law. In SERE school, our troops who are at
risk of capture are exposed in a controlled environment with great protections and caution- to techniques adapted
from abusive tactics used against American soldiers by enemies such as the CommunistChinese during the Korean
War. SERE training techniques include stress positions, forced nudity,use of fear, sleep deprivation and, until
recently, the Navy SERE school used the waterboard. These techniques were designed to give our students a taste
of what they might be subjected to if capturedby a ruthless, lawless enemy so that they wouldbe better prepared to
resist. The techniques were never intended to be used against detainees in U.S. custody. As one [Joint Personnel
Recovery Agency (JPRA)] instructorexplained, SERE training is based on illegal exploitation (under the rules listed

in the 1949 GenevaConvention RelativetotheTreati^nt of Prisoners of War) of prisoners over the last 50years."

See Resume, Hammond DUNBAR, submitted to the CIA in March 2003. In a section on "Interrogation and
Debriefing Experience," DUNBAR's 2003 resume noted that he had been a "debriefer for all USG DOD and
Civilian

interrogation experience as acontractor for the Cl^beginningin^

DUNBAR's resume did state that he had
1992, and that he had taken a one-week

Defense Interrogation Courseat some point in 2002, although his resume does not indicate whether this wasprior to,
or after, the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah. The CIA's June 2013 Response states that the Committee Study was
"incorrect... in asserting that thecontractors selected had no relevant experience." The CIA's June 2013 Response
notes SWIGERT and DUNBAR's experience at the Department of Defense SERE school, and SWIGERT's

"academic research" and "research papers"on "such topics as resistancetraining,captivity familiarization, and
learned helplessness - all of which were relevant to the development of the program." The CIA's June 2013
Responsedoes not describe any experience related to actual interrogations or counterterrorism, or any relevant
cultural, geographic, or linguistic expertise. TheCIA's June 2013 Response provides tliefollowing explanation:

"Drs. [SWIGERT] and [DUNBAR] had theclosest proximate expertise CIAsought at the beginning of the program,
specificallyin the area of non-standard meansof interrogation. Expertson traditional interrogation methods did not
meet this requirement. Non-standard interrogation methodologies were not an area of expertiseof CIA officersor of
the US Government generally. We believe their expertise was so unique that we would have been derelict had we
not sought them out when it became clear that CIA would be heading into the uncharted territoryof the program"
(italics and emphasis in original). As noted above, the CIA did not seek out SWIGERT and DUNBAR after a

decision was made to use coercive interrogation techniques; rather, SWIGERT and DUNBAR played a role in
convincing the CIA to adopt such a policy.

In May 2003, a senior CIA interrogator would tell personnel from
the CIA's Office of Inspector General that SWIGERT and DUNBAR's SERE school model was
based on resisting North Vietnamese "physical torture" and was designed to extract "confessions

for propaganda purposes" from U.S. airmen "who possessed little actionable intelligence." The
CIA, he believed, "need[ed] a different working model for interrogating terrorists where

confessions are not the ultimate goal."^^^

^/NF) After the July 2002 meetings, the CIA's |^^|CTC Legal,
|, drafted a letter to Attorney General John Ashcroft asking the Department of
Justice for "a formal declination of prosecution, in advance, for any employees of the United
States, as well as any other personnel acting on behalf of the United States, who may employ
methods in the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah that otherwise might subject those individuals to

prosecution."^"^Â® The letterfurther indicated that "the interrogation team had concluded" that
"the use of more aggressive methods is required to persuade Abu Zubaydah to provide the
critical information we need to safeguard the lives of innumerable innocent men, women and
children within the United States and abroad." The letter added that these "aggressive methods"
would otherwise be prohibited by the torture statute, "apart from potential reliance upon the

doctrines of necessity or of self-defense."^"^^ This letter was circulated internally at the CIA,
including to SWIGERT; however, there are no records to indicate it was provided to the attorney
general.

On July 13, 2002, HI^HCTC Legal,
and the CIA's acting general counsel, John Rizzo, met with attorneys from the National Security
Council and the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), as well as with Michael
Chertoff, the head of the Department of Justice Criminal Division, and Daniel Levin, the chief of
staff to the FBI director, to provide an overview of the CIA's proposed interrogation techniques
and to ask for a formal, definitive DOJ opinion regarding the lawfulness of employing the
specific CIA inten'ogation techniques against Abu Zubaydah.
The CIA attorneys described the 12 proposed interrogation

techniques and told the Department of Justice and National Security Council attorneys that Abu
Zubaydah continued to withhold critical intelligence on the identities of al-Qa'ida personnel in
the United States and planned al-Qa'ida attacks. The CIA attorneys also told the gi-oup that CIA
officers were complemented by:

methods of interrogation and the resistance techniques employed as
countermeasures to such interrogation."^"^
According to the CIA cable describing the meeting, the
representatives from the OLC, including Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo, advised
that the criminal prohibition on torture would not prohibit the methods proposed by the
interrogation team because of the absence of any specific intent to inflict severe physicalor

mental pain or sufferingJ"^^ On July 13,2002, Yoo sent an unclassified letter to the CIA's acting
general counsel describing his interpretation of the statute.
Despite the initial view expressed by Yoo that the use of the

proposed CIA interrogation techniques would be lawful, on July 17, 2002, National Security
Advisor Condoleezza Rice requested a delay in the approval of the interrogation techniques for
Abu Zubaydah's interrogation until the attorney general issued an opinion.The following
day. Rice and Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley requested that the Department
of Justice "delay the approval of the memo detailing the next phase of interrogations" until the
CIA provided specific details on its proposed interrogation techniques and "an explanation of
why the CIA is confident these techniques will not cause lasting and irreparable harm to Abu

Zubaydah."'"^'^ Rice asked the CIA to provide the OLC with a description ofeach of the planned
interrogation techniques, and to "gather and provide any available empirical data on the reactions
and likelihood of prolonged mental harm from the use of the 'water board' and the staged
burial."'^^

On July 15, 2002, a cable providing details on the proposed
interrogation phase stated that only the DETENTION SITE GREEN chief of Base would be
allowed to interrupt or stop an inteiTogation in process, and that the chief of Base would be the
final decision-making authority as to whether the CIA's interrogation techniques applied to Abu
Zubaydah would be discontinued. ^^Â® The CIA officers at the detention site added:
"If [Abu Zubaydah] develops a serious medical condition which may involve a
host of conditions including a heart attack or another catastrophic type of
condition, all efforts will be made to ensure that proper medical care will be
provided to [him]. In the event [Abu Zubaydah] dies, we need to be prepared
to act accordingly, keeping in mind the liaison equities involving our hosts.

To address these issues, the cable stated that if Abu Zubaydah were

to die during the interrogation, he would be cremated.The interrogation team closed the cable
by stating:

"regardless which [disposition] option we follow however, and especially in
light of the planned psychological pressure techniques to be implemented, we
need to get reasonable assurances that [Abu Zubaydah] will remain in isolation
and incommunicado for the remainder of his life,"^^^

Officers from the CIA's ALEC Station responded to the
interrogation team's comments several days later. Their cable noted that the interrogation team
was correct in its "understanding that the interrogation process takes precedence over
preventative medical procedures."ALEC Station further observed:

"There is a fairly unanimous sentiment witiiin HQS that [Abu Zubaydah] will
never be placed in a siaiation where he has any significant contact with others
and/or has the opportunity to be released. While it is difficult to discuss
specifics at this point, all major players are in concurrence that [Abu
Zubaydah] should remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life. This
may preclude [Abu Zubaydah] from being turned over to another country, but
a final decision regarding his future incarceration condition has yet to be
made."^^^

^ result of the request by National Security Advisor Rice for
additional research on the CIA's proposed interrogation techniques, CIA and DOJ personnel
contacted individuals at the Department of Defense's Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA),
the agency that administers the SERE school, to gather information about the effects of using the
techniques in training exercises.According to CIA officer
who had

mill joined the CIA's OTS after (j

at JPRA, an individual with SERE school

experience commented that "information gleaned via harsh treatment may not be accurate, as the
prisoner may say anything to avoid further pain," and that "[c]urrent doctrine for interrogations
conducted in the permanent phase of capture may lean towards 'soft' or 'indirect' rounds of
questioning. "157
Pursuant to National Security Advisor Rice's request, CIA
Headquarters personnel also requested information from the interrogation teamâparticularly

SWIGERT and DUNBARâaboutthe psychologicaleffects of the use of the waterboard and
mock burial. The chief of Base at DETENTION SITE GREEN responded by cable noting that:
"We are a nation of laws and we do not wish to parse words. A bottom line in
considering the new measures proposed is that [Abu Zubaydah] is being held
in solitary confinement, againsthis will, without legal representation, as an
enemy of our country, our society and our people. Therefore, while the
techniques described in Headquarters meetings and below are administered to
student volunteers in the U.S. in a harmless way, with no measurable impact
on the psyche of the volunteer, we do not believe we can assure the same here
for a man forced through these processes and who will be made to believe this
is the future course of the remainder of his life. Station, [DETENTION SITE
GREEN chief of Base] and [DETENTION SITE GREEN] personnel will make
every effort possible to insure [sic] that subject is not permanently physically
or mental harmed but we should not say at the outset of this process that there
is no risk."^^^

As former psychologists for the United States Air Force,
SWIGERT and DUNBAR had no direct experience with the waterboard, as it was not used in

Air Force SERE training. Nonetheless, they indicated that the waterboardâwhich they
described as an "absolutely convincing technique"âwas necessary to overwhelm Abu

Zubaydah's ability to resist.^^^ They also responded that they were aware that the Navyâwhich
used the waterboard technique in trainingâhad not reported any significant long-term
consequences on individuals from its use. Unlike the CIA's subsequent use of the waterboard,
however, the Navy's use of the technique was a single training exercise and did not extend to
multiple sessions. SWIGERT and DUNBAR wrote:

"any physical pressure applied to exti'emes can cause severe mental pain or
suffering. Hooding, the use of loud music, sleep deprivation, controlling
darkness and light, slapping, walling, or the use of stress positions taken to
extreme can have the same outcome. The safety of any technique lies
primarily in how it is applied and monitored.'^^^
On July 24, 2002, the attorney general verbally approved the use
of 10 interrogation techniques, which included: the attention grasp, walling, the facial hold, the
facial slap (insult slap), cramped confinement, wall standing, stress positions, sleep deprivation,
use of diapers, and use of insects.The interrogation team, however, indicated that they
intended to wait for the approval to use the waterboard before proceeding with their
interrogation of Abu Zubaydah. On July 26, 2002, the attorney general verbally approved the

use of the waterboardJ^^ The OLC finalized its classified writtenlegal opinion on August 1,
2002. The earlier CIA request to conduct a mock burial was not formally considered by the
OLC. The approved interrogation techniques, along with other CIA interrogation techniques
that were subsequently identified and used by the CIA, are referred to as the CIA's "enhanced
interrogation techniques," or more commonly by the CIA as "EITs."
course of seeking approval to use the techniques, CIA

Headquarters advised the Depaitment of Justice and the national security advisor that "countless
more Americans may die unless we can persuade AZ to tell us what he knows." CIA
Headquarters further represented that the DETENTION SITE GREEN interrogation team
believed "Abu Zubaydah continues to withhold critical threat information," and "that in order to
persuade him to provide" that information, "the use of more aggressive techniques is
required."^^^ The cable to DETENTION SITE GREEN from CIA Headquarters documenting
the information CIA Headquarters had provided to the Department of Justice warned that "[t]he
legal conclusions are predicated upon the determinations by the interrogation team that Abu

Zubaydah continues to withhold critical threat information."^^"^ According to cables, however,
the CIA interrogators at the detention site had not determined that "the use of more aggressive
techniques was required" to "persuade" Abu Zubaydah to provide threat information. Rather,
the interrogation team believed the objective of the coercive inten-ogation techniques was to
confirm Abu Zubaydah did not have additional information on threats to the United States,
writing:

"Our assumption is the objective of this operation is to achieve a high degree
of confidence that [Abu Zubaydah] is not holding back actionable information
concerning threats to the United States beyond that which [Abu Zubaydah] has

already provided."^^^
described in this summary, and in more detail in the full
Committee Study, the interrogation team later deemed the use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques a success, not because it resulted in critical threat information, but
because it provided further evidence that Abu Zubaydah had not been withholding the
aforementioned information from the interrogators.

As described, CIA officers represented to National Security
Advisor Rice that Abu Zubaydah was withholding information on pending attacks and operatives
in the United States. On July 31, 2002, Rice informed Deputy DCI John McLaughlin that, in
balancing the application of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against the possible
loss of American lives, she would not object to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques if
the attorney general determined them to be legal.
louring the month of July 2002, the CIA anticipated diat the
president would need to approve the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques before
they could be used. Therefore, in late July 2002, the CIA prepared talking points for a briefing
of the president. These draft talking points indicated that the CIA was planning to use
inteiTogation techniques beyond what was normally permitted by law enforcement, and included
a brief description of the waterboard interrogation technique. On August 1, 2002, based on
comments from White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, the talking points were revised to
eliminate references to the waterboard.CIA records indicate, however, that the talking points
were not used to brief the president. On August 2, 2002, the National Security Council legal
advisor informed the DCI's chief of staff that "Dr. Rice had been informed that there would be

no briefing of the President on this matter,but that the DCI had policy approval to employ
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.
records state that prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah in 2002, the CIA did not brief Secretary of State
Colin Powell or Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, two members of the National Security
Council, on the techniques.The Committee, including the chairman and vice chairman, was

also not briefed on the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques prior to their use.'^^
Approximately a year later, on July 31, 2003, senior CIA personnel
believed the president had still not been briefed on the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques.In August 2003, DCI Tenet told the CIA Office of Inspector General that "he had
never spoken to the President regarding the detention and interrogation program or EITs, nor was

Inspector General Special Review included a recommendation for the DCI to:
"Brief the President regarding the implementation of the Agency's detention
and inten-ogation activities pursuant to the MON of 17 September 2001 or any
other authorities, including the use of EITs and the fact that detainees have

died. This Recommendation is significant."^^^
In transmitting the Special Review to the Committee, DCI Tenet
responded to the recommendation, noting only that "[t]he DCI will determine whether and to

what extent the President requires a briefing on the Program."^^^ On April 6, 2006, CIA
Inspector General Helgerson responded to a request from Committee Vice Chairman John D.
Rockefeller IV on the status of con-ective actions taken in response to the Special Review
recommendations. With regard to a briefing for the president, Helgerson wrote: "Consistent
with this recommendation, DCI Tenet, before he left office, and Director Goss, shortly after

taking office, both advised me that they had made requests to briefthe President."^^^ Prepared
"Questions and Answers" for the National Security Council principals in connection with the
disclosure of the program in September 2006 and subsequent media outreach also suggest that
the president was not briefed at the outset about the CIA's interrogation techniques. In response
to the potential question: "What role did the President play.. .Was he briefed on the interrogation
techniques, and if so when?" the proposed answer did not assert that the president was briefed,
but rather that the "President was not of course involved in CIA's day to day operations including who should be held by CIA and how they should be questioned - these decisions are
made or overseen by CIA Directors.

subject are admittedly incomplete, former President Bush has stated in his autobiography that he discussed the

program, including the use of enhanced techniques, with DCIA Tenet in 2002, prior to application of the techniques
on Abu Zubaydah, and personally approved the techniques." A subsequent memoir by former CIA Acting General
Counsel John Rizzo (published January 7, 2014) states, "The one senior U.S. Government national security official
during this timeâfrom August 2002 through 2003âwho I did not believe was knowledgeable about the E.I.T.s was

them."

9. The CIA Uses the Waterboardand Other Enhanced Interrogation Techniques Against
Abu Zubaydah

On August 3, 2002, CIA Headquarters informed the interrogation
team at DETENTION SITE GREEN that it had formal approval to apply the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques, including the waterboard, against Abu Zubaydah. According to CIA
records, only the two CIA contractors, SWIGERT and DUNBAR, were to have contact with Abu

Zubaydah. Other CIA personnel at DETENTION SITE GREEN - including CIA medical
personnel and other CIA "interrogators with whom he is familiar" - were only to observe.
From August 4, 2002, through August 23, 2002, the CIA subjected

Abu Zubaydah to its enhanced inteiTogation techniques on a near 24-hour-per-day basis. After
Abu Zubaydah had been in complete isolation for 47 days, the most aggressive interrogation

phase began at approximately 11:50 AM on August 4, 2002.^^- Security personnel entered the
cell, shackled and hooded Abu Zubaydah, and removed his towel (Abu Zubaydah was then
naked). Without asking any questions, the interrogators placed a rolled towel around his neck as
a collar, and backed him up into the cell wall (an interrogator later acknowledged the collai' was

used to slam Abu Zubaydah against a concrete wall).'^^ The interrogators then removed the
hood, performed an attention grab, and had Abu Zubaydah watch while a large confinement box
was brought into the cell and laid on the floor.A cable states Abu Zubaydah "was unhooded
and the large confinement box was carried into the interrogation room and paced [sic] on the

floor so as to appear as a coffin."^^^ The interrogators then demanded detailed and verifiable
information on terrorist operations planned against the United States, including the names, phone
numbers, email addresses, weapon caches, and safe houses of anyone involved. CIA records
describe Abu Zubaydah as appearing apprehensive. Each time Abu Zubaydah denied having

additional information, the interrogators would perform a facial slap or face grab.^^^ At
approximately 6:20 PM, Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded for the first time. Over a two-and-ahalf-hour period, Abu Zubaydah coughed, vomited, and had "involuntary spasms of the torso and

extremities" during waterboarding.^^^ Detention site personnel noted that "throughout the
process [Abu Zubaydah] was asked and given the opportunity to respond to questions about
threats" to the United States, but Abu Zubaydah continued to maintain that he did not have any
additional information to provide,In an email to OMS leadership entitled, "So it begins," a
medical officer wrote:

"The sessions accelerated rapidly progressing quickly to the water board after
large box, walling, and small box periods. [Abu Zubaydali] seems very
resistant to the water board. Longest time with the cloth over his face so far
has been 17 seconds. This is sure to increase shortly. NO useful information

tlie U.S." According to the OIG's record of the interview, "[DUNBAR] and [SWIGERT] could ask that question in
a number of ways, but it was the only theme they were authorized by [chief of Base] to use with [Abu] Zubaydah."
{See February 10, 2003, interview report of Hammond DUNBAR, Office of the Inspector General.) The acting

chief ofStation inCountry |, in an interview with the CIA OIG, stated that "there were days at [DETENTION

(COB) the "flexibility as COBtoaskotherques^

Services at the CIA Station stated that "[SWIGERT] and [DUNBAR] were fmstrated that they kept beating

Zubaydah up on th^am^uestioi^Wl^etting the same physiologic response from him." {See May 21, 2003,
interview report of

Office of the Inspector General.) Other interviewees described how

analytical assumptions about Abu Zubaydah drove the interrogation process. {See May 22, 2003, inter^w report of

|, Office ofthe Inspector General; and February 27, 2003, interview report ofm
|, Office of theInspector General.) ChiefofCTC, Jose Rodriguez, toldthe OIG that "CTC subject
matter experts" pointed to intelligence that they said indicated that Abu Zubaydah knew more than he was admitting
and thus disagreed with the assessment from DETENTION SITE GREEN that Abu Zubaydah was "compliant."
According to the OIG's record of die Jose Rodriguez interview, "disagreement between the analysts and
interrogators can be healthy, but in this case Rodriguez believes that the analysts were wrong." {See interview of

//NF) The use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniquesincluding "walling, attention grasps, slapping, facial hold, stress positions, cramped confinement,
white noise and sleep deprivation"âcontinued in "varying combinations, 24 hours a day" for 17

straight days, through August 20, 2002}^^ When Abu Zubaydah was left alone during this
period, he was placed in a stress position, left on the waterboard with a cloth over his face, or

locked in one of two confinement boxes. According to the cables, Abu Zubaydah was also
subjected to the waterboard "2-4 times a day...with multiple iterations of the watering cycle
during each application."'^^
The "aggressive phase of interrogation" continued until August 23,

2002.^^^ Over the course ofthe entire 20 day "aggressive phase of interrogation," Abu Zubaydah
spent a total of 266 hours (11 days, 2 hours) in the large (coffin size) confinement box and 29

hours in a small confinement box, which had a width of 21 inches, a depth of 2.5 feet, and a
height of 2.5 feet. The CIA interrogators told Abu Zubaydah that the only way he would leave
the facility was in the coffin-shaped confinement box.'^^
According to the daily cables from DETENTION SITE GREEN,
Abu Zubaydah frequently "cried," "begged," "pleaded," and "whimpered," but continued to
deny that he had any additional information on current threats to, or operatives in, the United
States,

August 9, 2002, the sixth day of the interrogation period, the
interrogation team informed CIA Headquarters that they had come to the "collective preliminary
assessment" that it was unlikely Abu Zubaydah "had actionable new information about current
threats to the United States."On August 10, 2002, the interrogation team stated that it was

"highly unlikely" that Abu Zubaydah possessed the information they were seeking,On the
same day, the interrogation team reiterated a request for personnel from CIA Headquarters to

section [of the ICRC report] on medical care,thereport omits key contextual facts. For example, Abu Zubaydali's
statement that he was given only Ensure and water for two to three weeks fails to mention the fact that he was on a

liquid diet quite appropriate because he was recoveringfrom abdominal surgery at the time."

used against Abu Zubaydah in "varying combinations, 24 hours a day." The "aggressive phase," as defined by the
CIA, continued for an additional three days. TheCIAcontinued to use its enhanced interrogation techniques against
Abu Zubaydah until August 30,2002.

"first-hand, on-the-ground look is best," but if CIA Headquarters personnel could not visit, a
video teleconference would suffice.DETENTION SITE GREEN personnel also informed
CIA Headquarters that it was their assessment that the application of the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques was "approach[ing] the legal limit."^^^ The chiefof CTC, Jose
Rodriguez, responded:

"Strongly urge that any speculative language as to the legality of given
activities or, more precisely, judgment calls as to their legality vis-a-vis
operational guidelines for this activity agreed upon and vetted at the most
senior levels of the agency, be refrained from in written traffic (email or cable

traffic). Such language is nothelpful."^^^
detention SITE GREEN cables describe Abu Zubaydah as

"compliant," informing CIA Headquarters that when the interrogator "raised his eyebrow,
without instructions," Abu Zubaydah "slowly walked on his own to the water table and sat

down."^Â®'^ When the inten'ogator "snappedhis fingers twice," Abu Zubaydah would lie flat on
the waterboard.^Â®^ Despite the assessment of personnel at the detention site that Abu Zubaydah
was compliant, CIA Headquarters stated that they continued to believe that Abu Zubaydah was
withholding threat information and instructed the CIA interrogators to continue using the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques.

Abu Zubaydah remained unresponsive until medical intervention, when he regained
consciousness and expelled "copious amounts of liquid." This experience with the waterboard
was referenced in emails, but was not documented or otherwise noted in CIA cables.^^^ When

two CIA Headquarters officers later compared the Abu Zubaydah interrogation videotapes to the
cable record, neither commented on this session. A review of the catalog of videotapes,
however, found that recordings of a 21-hour period, which included two waterboarding sessions,

CIA personnel at DETENTION SITE GREEN reported being

disturbed by the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against Abu Zubaydah.
CIA records include the following reactions and comments by CIA personnel:
â¢

August 5, 2002: "want to caution [medical officer] that this is almost certainly not a
place he's ever been before in his medical career...It is visually and psychologically
very uncomfortable."^Â®^

August 8, 2002: "Today's first session.. .had a profound effect on all staff members
present.. .it seems the collective opinion that we should not go much
further.. .everyone seems strong for now but if the group has to continue.. .we cannot
guarantee how much longer."-^Â®

August 8, 2002: "Several on the team profoundly affected.. .some to the point of

2'-'' See Abu Zubaydah detainee review in Volume III for detailson Abu Zubaydah's intelligence production. As
noted, Abu Zubaydah was taken into CIA custodyon March
2002, and was hospitalized until April 15, 2002.
During the months of April and May 2002, which included a periodduring which Abu Zubaydahwas on life support
and unable to speak, the interrogations of Abu Zubaydah produced 95 intelligencereports. Abu Zubaydah spent
much of June 2002 and all of July 2002 in isolation, without being asked any questions. The CIA reinstituted
contact with Abu Zubaydah on August 4, 2002, and immediately began using the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniquesâincluding the waterboard. During the months of August iuid September 2002, Abu Zubaydah produced
91 intelligence reports, four fewer than the first two months of his CIA detention. CIA records indicate tliat the type
of intelligence Abu Zubaydah provided remained relatively constant prior to and after the use of the CIA's enhanced
intenogation techniques. According to CIA records, Abu Zubaydah provided information on "al-Qa'ida activities,
plans, capabilities,and relationships," in addition to information on "its leadership structure,including personalities,
decision-making processes, tiaining, and tactics." See also CIA paper entitled "Abu Zubaydah," dated March 2005,

as well as "Abu Zubayd^iBio|^dorament, "Prepare^)r^^ugus^006."
On August 30, 2002,
l-^egal,

discuss Abu Zubaydah's interrogation. See email fi:om: John Rizzo; to: John Moseman; subject: Meeting with NSC
Legal Adviser; date: August 30, 2002; ALEC
(052227ZSEP 02). In his email documenting the meeting,
'noted that we had employed the walling techniques, confinement box, waterboaid, along witli some of
the otlier methods which also had been approved by the Attorney General," and "reported that while the experts at
tlie site and at Headquarters were still assessing the product of the recent sessions, it did appear that the current
phase was producing meaningful results." (See email from: John Rizzo; to: John Moseman; subject: Meeting with
NSC Legal Adviser; date: August 30, 2002.) The email did not provide any additional detail on what was described
to Bellinger with respect to either the use of the techniques or the "results" of the inten ogation. It is unclear from
CIA records whether the CIA ever informed the NSC Legal Adviser or anyone else at the NSC or the Department of
Justice that Abu Zubaydah failed to provide information about futme attacks against the United States or operatives
tasked to commit attacks in the U.S. during or after the use of tlie CIA's enhanced intenogation techniques.

DETENTION SITE GREEN, which CIA records indicate was authored by SWIGERT and
DUNBAR, also viewed the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah as a success. The cable
recommended that "the aggressive phase at [DETENTION SITE GREEN] should be used as a
template for future interrogation of high value captives,"^'^ not because the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques produced useful information, but rather because their use confirmed that

Abu Zubaydah did not possess the intelligence that CIA Headquarters had assessed Abu
Zubaydah to have. The cable from the detention site stated:

"Our goal was to reach the stage where we have broken any will or ability of
subject to resist or deny providing us information (intelligence) to which he
had access. We additionally sought to bring subject to the point that we
confidently assess that he does not/not possess undisclosed threat information,
or intelligence that could prevent a terrorist event."~"^

The cable further recommended that psychologistsâa likely
reference to contractors SWIGERT and DUNBAR â "familiar with interrogation, exploitation
and resistance to interrogation should shape compliance of high value captives prior to
debriefing by substantive experts."-^^
From Abu Zubaydah's capture on March 28, 2002, to his transfer

to Department of Defense custody on September 5, 2006, infomiation provided by Abu
Zubaydah resulted in 766 disseminated intelligence reports."^^ According to CIA documents,
Abu Zubaydah provided information on "al-Qa'ida activities, plans, capabilities, and
relationships," in addition to information on "its leadership structure, including personalities,
decision-making processes, training, and tactics."-'^ As noted, this type of information was
provided by Abu Zubaydah before, during, and after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques. At no time during or after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques
According to CIA records, on September 27, 2002, the CIA briefed the chairman and the vice chairman of the

Committee, Senators Graham andShelby, as well as the Committee staffdirectors, on AbuZubaydiili's
interrogation. The CIA's memorandum of the briefing indicates that the chairman and vice chairman were briefed

on "the enhanced techniques that had been employed," as well as "die nature and quality of reporting provided by
Abu Zubaydah." See (DIRECTOR

The Committee uses sole-source intelligence reporting in this summary. While CIA multi-source intelligence
reports are included in the full Committee Study, the focus of the Committee analysisis on sole-source intelligence
reporting, as these reports were deemed to more accurately reflect useful reporting from individual CIA detainees.
As background, multi-source intelligence reports are reports that contain data from multiple detainees. For example,
a common multi-source report would result from the CIA showing a picture of an individual to all CIA detainees at

a specific CIA detention site. A report would be produced regardless if detainees wereor were not able to identify
or provide infomiation on the individual. As a specific example, see HEADQUARTERS
(202255Z JUN
06), which states that from January 1, 2006 - April 30, 2006, information from Hanibali was "used in the

dissemination of three intelligence reports, twoof which were non-recognitions of Guantanamo Baydetainees," and
the third of which "detailed [Hambali's] statement that he knew of no threats or plots to attack any world sporting
events." Sole-source reports, by contrast, are basedon specific information provided by one CIA detainee.

did Abu Zubaydah provide information about operatives in, or future attacks against, the United
States.

10. A CIA Presidential Daily BriefProvides Inaccurate Information on the Interrogation of
Abu Zubaydah

Although CIA personnel at DETENTION SITE GREEN agreed
that Abu Zubaydah was compliant and cooperative, personnel at CIA Headquarters prepared a
Presidential Daily Brief (PDB) in October 2002 that, according to a cable, "accurately reflect[ed]

the collective HQS view of the information provided [by Abu Zubaydah] to date."-^^ The
October 2002 PDB stated Abu Zubaydah was still withliolding "significant threat information,"
including information on operatives in the United States, and that Abu "Zubaydah resisted
providing useful information until becoming more cooperative in early August, probably in the

hope of improving his living conditions.""^'^ The PDB made no reference to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques or the counter-assessment from the detention site interrogation team

indicating that Abu Zubaydah was cooperative and not withholding information.^^^
documents identified the "key intelligence" acquired from

Abu Zubaydah as information related to suspected terrorists Jose Padilla and Binyam
Mohammad, information on English-speaking al-Qa'ida member Jaffar al-Tayyar, and
information identifying KSM as the mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks who used the
alias "Mukhtar."^^^ All of this information was acquired by FBI special agents shortly after Abu

Zubaydah's capture.^^^
The CIA has consistently represented that Abu Zubaydah stated
that the CIA's enhanced inten'ogation techniques were necessary to gain his cooperation. For
example, the CIA informed the OLC that:

"As Zubaydah himself explained with respect to enhanced techniques,
'brothers who are captured and interrogated aie permitted by Allah to provide

briefings on several dates, including for a 2009 briefing to Director Leon Panetta, as well as the "Effectiveness
Memo" provided to the Department of Justice, testimony provided by CIA Director Michael Hayden, and other
documents discussed in detail in Volume 11. For example, see ODNI September 2006 press release stating: "During
initial inteiTogation, Abu Zubaydah gave some information that he probably viewed as nominal. Some was
important,however,including that Khalid ShaykhMohammad (KSM) was the 9/11 mastermind and used the
moniker 'Mukhtar.' This identification allowed us to comb previously collected intelligence for both names,
opening up new leads to this terrorist plotterâleads that eventuallyresulted in his capture. It was clear to his
intenogators that Abu Zubaydali possessed a great deal of information about al-Qa'ida; however, he soon stopped
all cooperation. Over the ensuing months, the CIA designed a new interrogation program that would be safe,
effective, and legal."

information when they believe they have 'reached the limit of their ability to
withhold it' in the face of psychological and physical hardships.
As is described in greater detail in the full Committee Study, CIA
records do not support the CIA representation that Abu Zubaydah made these statements.^^^ CIA
records indicate that Abu Zubaydah maintained that he always intended to talk and never

believed he could withhold information from interrogators.^^'^ In February 2003, Abu Zubaydah
told a CIA psychologist that he believed prior to his capture that every captured "brother" would
talk in detention and that he told individuals at a terrorist training camp that "brothers should be
able to expect that the organization will make adjustments to protect people and plans when
someone with knowledge is captured.""^'
11. The CIA Does Not Brief the Committee on the Interrogation ofAbu Zubaydah
I" contrast to relatively open communications that the CIA had

with the Committee following the issuance of the September 17, 2001, MON, the CIA
significantly limited its communications with the Committee on its detention and interrogation

activities after Abu Zubaydah's capture on March 28, 2002.^^^ In responses to three different
sets of Committee Questions for the Record addressed to the CIA regarding the MON authorities
in the spring and summer of 2002, the CIA provided no indication that the CIA had established
DETENTION SITE GREEN, or was using, or considering using, coercive interrogation
techniques.'-^^

On September 27, 2002, CIA officials provided a briefing on Abu
Zubaydah's interrogation only to Committee Chairman Bob Graham, Vice Chairman Richard
Shelby, and their staff directors. After this briefing Chairman Graham made multiple and

Country | during this period that the CIA remains unable to determine the number and identity
of the individuals it detained. The full details of the CIA interrogations there remain largely
unknown, as DETENTION SITE COBALT was later found to have not reported multiple uses of

reduced quantity and quality of food, nudity, and "rough treatment" of CIA detainees.

CIA's Enhanced Interrogation Techniques on Ridha al-Najjar

Ridha al-Najjar was the first CIA detainee to be held at

While the CIA was describing to the Department of Justice why it
needed to use the CIA's enhanced inten*ogation techniques against Abu Zubaydah, a parallel
internal discussion at the CIA was taking place regarding Ridha al-Najjar. An ALEC Station
cable from a CTC officer stated that, on June 27, 2002:

"ALEC/HQS held a strategy session regarding the interrogation of high

priority

detainee Ridha Ahmed al-Najjar in [Country |]. The

goal of the session was to review the progress of the interrogation to date and

to devise a general plan as to how best to proceed once the new [Country |

A cable followed on July 16,
suggesting possible interrogation techniques to use

utilizing "Najjar's fear for the well-being of his family to our benefit," with the cable
explicitly stating that interrogators could not "threaten his family with imminent death";

using "vague threats" to create a "mind virus" that would cause al-Najjar to believe that
his situation would continue to get worse until he cooperated;^^^
manipulating Ridha al-Najjar's environment using a hood, restraints, and music; and

â¢

employing sleep deprivation through the use of round-the-clock interrogations.253

The cable went on to note that the "possibility that [al-Najjar] may
have current threat or lead information demands that we keep up the pressure on him."^^"^ With
the exception of a brief mention of "diminished returns from the most recent interviews of al-

Najjar," and references to the detainee's complaints about physical ailments, the cable offers no
evidence al-Najjar was actively resisting CIA interrogators."^^

Ten days later, on July 26, 2002, CIA officers in Country |, none
of whom had been trained in the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, proposed

putting al-Najjar in isolation^^^ and using "sound disorientation techniques," "sense of time
deprivation," limited light, cold temperatures, and sleep deprivation.^^^ The CIA officers added
that they felt they had a "reasonable chance of breaking Najjar" to get "the intelligence and

August 5, 2002, the day after Abu Zubaydah's interrogation
using the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques at DETENTION SITE GREEN began, CIA
Headquarters autliorized the proposed interrogation plan for al-Najjar, to include the use of loud
music (at less than the level that would cause physical harm such as permanent hearing loss),
worse food (as long as it was nutritionally adequate for sustenance), sleep deprivation, and

hooding.^^^
More than a month later, on September 21, 2002, CIA interrogators
described al-Najjar as "clearly a broken man" and "on the verge of complete breakdown" as
result of the isolation.^^^ The cable added that al-Najjarwas willing to do whatever the CIA
officer asked.

In October 2002, officers from the U.S. military conducted a short

debriefing of al-Najjar at DETENTION SITE COBALT and subsequently expressed an interest

in a more thorough debriefing.^^^ On November

2002, a U.S. military legal advisor visited

DETENTION SITE COBALT and described itas a"CIA detentioi^acility/^ioting that "while
CIA is the only user of the facility they contend it is a [Country

facility."^^"^

The U.S. military officer also noted that the junior CIA officer designated as warden of the
facility "has little to no experience with interrogating or handling prisoners." With respect to alNajjar specifically, the legal advisor indicated that the CIA's interrogation plan included
"isolation in total darkness; lowering the quality of his food; keeping him at an uncomfortable
temperature (cold); [playing music] 24 hours a day; and keeping him shackled and hooded." In
addition, al-Najjar was described as having been left hangingâwhich involved handcuffing one
or both wrists to an overhead bar which would not allow him to lower his ai*msâfor 22 hours

each day for two consecutive days, in order to "'break' his resistance." It was also noted alNajjar was wearing a diaper and had no access to toilet facilities.
niilitary legal advisor concluded that, because of alNajjar's treatment, and die concealment of the facility from the ICRC, military participation in

al-Najjai*'s interrogation would involve risks for the U.S. military HHm. The legal advisor

4. Death of Gul Rahman Leads CIA Headquarters to Learn of Unreported Coercive
Interrogation Techniques at DETENTIONSITE COBALT; CIA Inspector General
Review Reveals Lack of Oversight of the Detention Site
In November 2002, ALEC Station officers requested that CIA

contract interrogator Hammond DUNBAR, one of the two primary interrogators of Abu
Zubaydah in August 2002, travel to DETENTION SITE COBALT to assess a detainee for the

possible use ofthe CIA's enhanced interrogationtechni^^

While DUNBAR was present at

DETENTION SITE COBALT, he assistedfl^^HllB [CIA OFFICER I] in the

interrogations of Gul Rahman, a suspected Islamic extremist. As reported to CIA Headquarters,
this interrogation included "48 hours of sleep deprivation, auditory overload, total darkness,
isolation, a cold shower, and rough treatment." CIA Headquarters did not approve these
interrogation techniques in advance. Upon receipt of these cables, however, officers at CIA
Headquarters responded that they were "motivated to extract any and all operational information
on al-Qa'ida and Hezbi Islami from Gul Rahman" and suggested that "enhanced measures"
might be needed to gain Gul Rahman's compliance. CIA Headquarters also requested that a

psychological assessment of Rahman be completed.^^^ Prior to DUNBAR's departure from the

detention site on November | , 2002, [a few days before the death ofGul Rahman] DUNBAR
proposed the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on other detainees and offered

suggestions to

[CIA OFFICER 1], the site manager, on the use of such techniques.^^^

On November!, 2002,

[CIA OFFICER 1] ordered that

Gul Rahman be shackled to the wall of his cell in a position that required the detainee to rest on
the bare concrete floor. Rahman was wearing only a sweatshirt, as
[CIA OFFICER 1]
had ordered that Rahman's clothing be removed when he had been judged to be uncooperative

during an earlier interrogation. The nextday, the guards found Gul Rahman's dead body. An
internal CIA review and autopsy assessed that Rahman likely died from hypothermiaâin part

[CIA

death of Gul Rahman resulted in increased attention to CIA

detention and interrogation activities inCountry | by CIA Headquarters. The CTC formally
designated the CTC's Renditions Group^^"^ as the responsible entity for the management and
maintenance of all CIA interrogation facilities, including DETENTION SITE COBALT, in early

December 2002.-^^ Despite this change, many of the sameindividuals within the CIAâ
including DUNBAR, officers at DETENTION SITE COBALT, and officers within ALEC
Station who had recommended the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against
Gul Rahmanâ^remained key figures in the CIA inteiTogation program and received no reprimand
or sanction for Rahman's death. Instead, in Maich 2003, just four months after the death of Gul

27^ DIRECTOrI^^I^^I^I^^^I^ In late 2005, the CIA convened an Accountability Board to review the
actions of CIA personnel in Gul Rahman's death. The board recommended that the executive director "impose a 10

day suspension without pay" on I^BUI |CIA OFFICER 1], and noted that this action would "strike the
appropriate balance between: I) the fact that [miil^l
OFFICER 1]] was the only individual who made
decisions that led directly, albeit unintentionally, to Rahman's death, and 2) the significant weight the Board
attached to the mitigating factors at play in this incident." {See Memorandumfor Executive Director from

HI, Deputy Director for Science and Technology, re: Report and Recommendations of the Special Accountability
Board Regarding the Death ofAfghar^etainee Gul Rahman.) On February 10, 2006, however, the CIA Executive
Director K.B. Foggo notified ||[H|H [CIA OFFICER 1] that he intended to take no disciplinary action against
liim. In his memo describing that decision, the executive director stated: "Wliile not condoning your actions, it is
imperative, in my view, that they... be judged within the operational context that existed at the time of Raliman's
detention. Cable traffic reviewed by the board shows conclusively that Headquarters generally was awaie of, and

Bosed no objections to, the confinement conditions and interrogation techniques beii^ imposed on Rahman as late as
I November. On that date. Headquarters notified [the CIA Station in COUNTRY |]... that it was 'motivated to

extract any and all operational information' from Rahman, that it rated achieving Rahman's cooperation to be of
'great importance' and that it acknowledged that Ralunan 'may need to be subjectedtoenhancedm

measures to induce him to comply." (See February 10, 2006, Memorandum for [^HI^HHH

OFFICER

1]], CounterTerrorist Center, National Clandestine Service, from Executive Director, re; "Accountability Decision.")
Witli regard to the death of Gul Raliman, the CIA's June 2013 Response states: "Most egregiously, we believe that
CIA leaders erred in not holding anyone formally accountable for the actions and failure of management related to
the death of Gul Raliman at [COBALT] in 2002. We understand the reasoning underlying CIA management's
decision to overturn an accountability board recommendation that would have imposed sanctions on the least

Later investigations of DETENTION SITE COBALT conducted

by tlie CIA inspector general and the deputy director of operations following the death of Gul
Rahman found that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniquesâand other coercive
interrogation techniquesâwas more widespread than was reported in contemporaneous CIA
cables. Specifically, the interrogation techniques that went unreported in CIA cables included

standing sleep deprivation in which a detainee's arms were shackled above his head, nudity,
dietary manipulation, exposure to cold temperatures, cold showers, "rough takedowns," and, in
at least two instances, the use of mock executions

Raliman at COBALT. "According to [DUNBAR], there were approximately five CIA officers from the renditions
team. Each one had a role during the takedown and it was thoroughly planned and rehearsed. They opened the door
of Rahman's cell and rushed in screaming and yelling for him to 'get down.' They dragged him outside, cut off his
clothes and securedhim with Mylartape. Theycovered his head with a hood and ran him up and down a long

corridor adjacent to his cell. They slapped him andpunched him several times. [DUNBAR] stated that although it
was obvious they were not trying to hit him as hard as they could, a couple of times the punches were forceful. As
they ran him along the corridor, a couple of timeshe fell and they dragged him through the dirt (the floor outside of
the cells is dirt). Rahman did acquire a numberof abrasions on his face, legs, and hands, but nothingthat required
medical attention. (This may account for the abrasions found on Rahman's body after his death. Rahman had a
number of surface abrasions on his shoulders,pelvis, arms, legs, and face.) At this point, Rahman was returned to

his cell and secured. [DUNBAR] stated that [tl^HIHrih [CIA OFFICER 1]] [the CIA officer in charge of

In January 2003, CIA Inspector General John Helgerson began a
formal review of the death of Gul Rahman and began a separate review of the entire CIA
Detention and Interrogation Program. The resulting Special Review of Counterterrorism
Detention and Interrogation Activities ("Special Review") found that there were no guidelines
for the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques at DETENTION SITE COBALT
prior to December 2002, and that interrogators, some with little or no training, were "left to their
own devices in working with detainees.

The Inspector Generars Special Review also revealed the lack of
oversight of DETENTION SITE COBALT by CIA leadership. DCI Tenet stated that he was

"not very familiar" with DETENTION SITE COBALT and "whaUh^I^s doing with medium
value targets,"^^^ Associate Deputy Director of Operations

stated that he was

unaware that the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were being used there.^^^ In August
2003, CIA General Counsel Scott Muller relayed that he was under the impression that
DETENTION SITE COBALT was only a holding facility and that he had "no idea who is

responsible for [COBALT].Senior Deputy General Counsel John Rizzo informed the OIG
that he knew little about DETENTION SITE COBALT and that his focus was on DETENTION

SITE GREEN and DETENTION SITE BLUE.-^^ CTC Chief ofOperations â¢â¢
stated that he had much less knowledge of operations at DETENTION SITE
COBALT, and that the CIA's GREEN and BLUE detention sites were much more important to

him.^^^ Finally, Chief of CTC Jose Rodriguez stated thathe did not focus on DETENTION

them and are satisfied with their qualifications and suitability for what are
clearly unusual measures that are lawful only when practiced correctly by
personnel whose records clearly demonstrate their suitability for that role. The
vetting process will not be that dissimilar from the checks that are provided by
the OIG, OS, etc. in certain cases before individuals are promoted or receive
awards, and the selection and training of aggressive interrogators certainly
warrants a similar vetting process.

UNÂ¥) The chief of CTC, Jose Rodriguez, objected to this approach.

stating;

"I do not think that CTC/LGL should or would want to get into the business of
vetting participants, observers, instructors or others that are involved in this
program. It is simply not your job. Your job is to tell all what are the
acceptable legal standards for conducting interrogations per the authorities

obtained from Justice and agreed upon by the White House,"^^^

(T!8^^mi|||||H//NF) Contrary to statements later made by CIA Director Michael
Hayden and other CIA officials that "[a]ll those involved in the questioning of detainees are
carefully chosen and screened for demonstrated professional judgment and maturity,CIA
records suggest that the vetting sought by
did not take place. The Committee
reviewed CIA records related to several CIA officers and contractors involved in the CIA's

Detention and Interrogation Program, most of whom conducted interrogations. The Committee
identified a number of personnel whose backgrounds include notable derogatory information
calling into question their eligibility for employment, their access to classified information, and
their participation in CIA interrogation activities. In nearly all cases, the derogatory information
was known to the CIA prior to the assignment of the CIA officers to the Detention and
Interrogation Program. This group of officers included individuals who, among other issues, had
engaged in inappropriate detainee interrogations, had workplace anger management issues, and
had reportedly admitted to sexual assault.

COBALT included the use of interrupted sleep, loud music, and reduction in food quality and
quantity. Less than a month after the death of Gul Rahman from suspected hypothermia, the
plans also called for detainees' clothes to be removed in a facility that was described to be 45
degrees Fahrenheit. CIA Headquarters approved the proposals for these detainees, whom the
CIA described as "Medium Value."-^^

Prior to this, in November 2002, a delegation of several officers
from the Federal Bureau of Prisons conducted an assessment of DETENTION SITE COBALT.

Following the November B, 2002, through November 2002, visit,^^^ CIA officers in Countiy
I remarked that the Federal Bureau ofPrisons assessments, along with recommendations and
training, had "made a noticeable improvement on how the day to day operations at the facility
are performed," and made the detention site a "more secure and safer working environment for
officers."'^^

On December 4, 2002, officers at CIA Headquarters met with
individuals from the Federal Bureau of Prisons to learn more about their inspection of

DETENTION SITE COBALT and their training ofmH|| security staff.During that
meeting, the Federal Bureau of Prisons personnel described DETENTION SITE COBALT and
stated that there was "absolutely no talking inside the facility," that the guards do not interact

with the prisoners, and that "[e]verything is done in silence and [in] the dark."^Â®Â® According to a
CIA officer, the Federal Bureau of Prisons staff also commented that "they were 'WOW'ed'" at
first by the facility, because:

"They have never been in a facility where individuals are so sensory deprived,
i.e., constant white noise, no talking, everyone in tiie dark, with the guards
wearing a light on their head when they collected and escorted a detainee to an
interrogation cell, detainees constantly being shackled to the wall or floor, and
the starkness of each cell (concrete and bars). There is nothing like this in the
Federal Bureau of Prisons. They then explained that they understood the
mission and it was their collective assessment that in spite of all this sensory
deprivation, the detainees were not being treated in humanely [sic]. They
explained that the facility was sanitary, there was medical care and the guard
force and our staff did not mistreat the detainee[s]."^Â®^
By the end of December 2002, the CIA Renditions Group that had
visited DETENTION SITE COBALT had concluded that the detention facility's initial "baseline
conditions" involved so much deprivation that any further deprivation would have limited impact

individuals who crafted the process" review the interrogation process and conditions, and that a

legal review be conducted.^Â®^ CIA Headquarters does not appear to have taken action on these
recommendations.

8. The CIA Places CIA Detainees in Country | Facilities Because They Did Not Meet the
MON Standardfor Detention

^

spring of 2003, the CIA continued to hold detainees at

facilities in CountryB who were known not to meet the MON standard for detention. CIA

officer

[CIA OFFICER 1] described the arrangement he had with Country |

officers in an email, writing:

|. They also happen to have 3 or 4 rooms where they can lock up people
discretely [sic]. I give them a few hundred bucks a month and they use the
rooms for whoever I bring over - no questions asked. It is vei7 useful for
housing guys that shouldn't be in [DETENTION SITE COBALT] for one
reason or another but still need to be kept isolated and held in secret
detention."^Â®^
cables indicate that CIA officers transferred at least four

detainees to these Country | facilities because they did not meet the standard for CIA detention
under the MON.^^^

In total, four CIA detention facilities were established in Country
CIA records indicate that DETENTION SITE COBALT held a total of 64 detainees during

the period of its operation between Septem^r 2002 anc^^H2004, while DETENTION SITE
GRAY held eight detainees between

2003 and

^003. The CIA later

established two other Cl^acilities in^Countr^B: DETENTION SITE ORANGE, which held

held 12 detainees between^^B 2006 and 2008.^Â®^

9. DCI TenetEstablishes First Guidelines on Detention Conditions and Interrogation;
Formal Consolidation of Program Administration at CIA Headquarters Does Not
Resolve Disagreements Among CIA Personnel
In late Januaiy 2003, in response to the death of CIA detainee Gul

Rahman and the use of a gun and a drill in the CIA interrogations of 'Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri
(described later in this summary), DCI Tenet signed the first formal interrogation and
confinement guidelines for the program."*^^ In contrast to proposals from late 2001, when CIA
personnel expected that any detention facility would have to meet U.S. prison standards, the
confinement guidelines signed in January 2003 set forth minimal standards for a detention
facility. The confinement guidelines required only that the facility be sufficient to meet basic
health needs, meaning that even a facility like DETENTION SITE COBALT, in which detainees
were kept shackled in complete dai-kness and isolation, with a bucket for human waste, and
without notable heat during the winter months, met the standard.^^^^
The guidelines also required quarterly assessments of the
conditions at the detention facilities. The first quarterly review of detention facilities covered the
period from January 2003 to April 2003, and examined conditions at DETENTION SITE

COBALT, as well as at DETENTION SITE BLUE in a different country. Country
At that
time, DETENTION SITE BLUE, which was initially designed for two detainees, was housing
five detainees. Nonetheless, the site review team found that conditions at DETENTION SITE

BLUE âincluding the three purpose-built "holding units"âmet "the minimum standards set by
the CIA" in the January 2003 guidance. Detainees received bi-weekly medical evaluations,
bmshed their teeth once a day, washed their hands prior to each meal, and could bathe once a
week. Amenities such as solid food, clothing (sweatshirts, sweatpants, and slippers), reading
materials, prayer rugs, and Korans were available depending on the detainee's degree of
cooperation with interrogators.
The first quarter 2003 review also found that conditions at

DETENTION SITE COBALT satisfied the January 2003 guidance, citing "significant
improvements" such as space heaters and weekly medical evaluations. The review noted that a

new facility was under construction in Country |[ to replace DETENTION SITE COBALT, and

that this new detention facility, DETENTION SITE ORANGE, "will be a quantum leap
forward" because "litj will incorporate heating/air conditioning, conventional plumbing,

appropriate
)propri
lighting, shower, and laundry facilitles."^^^ DETENTION SITE ORANGE opened

in 1^(12004. Although some of the cells at DETENTION SITE ORANGE included plumbing,

detainees undergoing interrogation were kept in smaller cells, with waste buckets rather than
toilet facilities.^

The DCl's January 2003 interrogation guidelines listed 12
"enhanced techniques" that could be used with prior approval of the director of CTC, including
twoâuse of diapers for "prolonged periods" and the abdominal slapâthat had not been
evaluated by the OLC. The "enhanced techniques" were only to be employed by "approved
interrogators for use with [a] specific detainee." The guidelines also identified "standard
techniques"âincluding sleep deprivation up to 72 hours, reduced caloric intake, use of loud
music, isolation, and the use of diapers "generally not to exceed 72 hours"âthat required
advance approval "whenever feasible," and directed that their use be documented. The "standard
techniques" were described as "techniques that do not incorporate physical or substantial
psychological pressure." The guidelines provided no description or further limitations on the use

of eitherthe enhanced or standard interrogation techniques.^^^
Although the DCl interrogation guidelines were prepared as a
reaction to the death of Gul Rahman and the use of unauthorized interrogation techniques on
*Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, they did not reference all interrogation practices that had been
employed at CIA detention sites. The guidelines, for example, did not address whether

interrogation techniques such as the "rough take down,"^^^ the use of cold water showers,^^'^ and
prolonged light deprivation were prohibited. In addition, by requiring advance approval of
"standard techniques" "whenever feasible," the guidelines allowed CIA officers a significant
amount of discretion to determine who could be subjected to the CIA's "standard" interrogation
techniques, when those techniques could be applied, and when it was not "feasible" to request
advance approval from CIA Headquarters. Thus, consistent with the interrogation guidelines,
throughout much of 2003, CIA officers (including personnel not trained in interrogation) could,
at their discretion, strip a detainee naked, shackle him in the standing position for up to 72 hours,

and douse the detainee repeatedly with cold water^^^âwithout approval from CIA Headquarters
if those officers judged CIA Headquarters approval was not "feasible." In practice, CIA
personnel routinely applied these types of interrogation techniques without obtaining prior

approval.^

One cold water shower was described by a CIA linguist; "Rahman was placed back under the cold water by the
guards at
[CIA OFFICER l]]'s direction. Rahman was so cold that he could barely utter his alias.
According to [tlie on-site linguist], the entire process lasted no more tlian 20 minutes. It was intended to lower
Rahman's resistance and was not for hygienic reasons. At the conclusion of the shower, Rahman was moved to one

oftlie four sleep deprivation cells where hewas left shivering for hours oroveniiglUwitlUii^and chained over his
head." See CIA Inspector General, Report of Investigation, Death of a Detainee

Water dousing was not designated by the CIA as a "standard" interrogation technique until June 2003. In
January 2004 water dousing was recategorized by the CIA as an "enhanced" inteiTogation technique.

The DCI interrogation guidelines also included the first
requirements related to recordkeeping, instaicting that, for "each interrogation session in which
an enhanced technique is employed," the field prepare a "substantially contemporaneous
record... setting forth the nature and duration of each such technique employed, the identities of
those present, and a citation to the required Headquarters approval cable.In practice, these
guidelines were not followed.

There were also administrative changes to the program. As noted,
on December 3, 2002, CTC's Renditions Group formally assumed responsibility for the
management and maintenance of all CIA detention and interrogation facilities.^^^ Prior to that

time^h^nterrogation program was "joined at the hip" with CTC's ALEC Station, according to
I^H^IcTC Legal, although another CTC attorney who was directly involved in the
program informed the CIA OIG that she "was never sure what group in CTC was responsible for
interrogation activities.Even after the formal designation of the CIA's Renditions Group, 321
tensions continued, particularly between CTC personnel who supported SWIGERT and
DUNBAR's continued role, and the Renditions Group, which designated
as the

3'^ DIRECTOR â¢â¢

(302126Z JAN 03); DIRECTOR

(311702Z JAN 03). Despite the formal record

keeping requirement, the CIA's June 2013 Response argues that detailed reporting on the use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques at CIA detention sites was not necessary, stating: "First, the decline in reporting over time
on the use of enhanced techniques, which the Study characterizes as poor or deceptive record keeping, actually
reflects the matiuation of the program. In early 2003, a process was put in place whereby interrogators requested
permission in advance for interrogation plans. The use of these plans for each detainee obviated the need for
reporting in extensive detail on the use of specific techniques, unless there were deviations from the approvedplan."
As detailed in the Study, the process put in place by the CIA in early 2003 explicitly required record keeping,
including "the nature and duration of each such techniqueemployed, the identities of those present, and a citation to
the required Headquarters approval cable." That requirement was never revised.
Subsequent to the January 2003 guidance, many cables reporting the use of the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation
techniques listed the techniques used on a particular day, but did not describe the frequency with which those
techniques were employed, nor did they integrate the specific techniques into narratives of the interrogations. As the
CIA interrogation program continued, descriptions of the use of the CIA's enhanced inteiTOgation techniques were
recorded in increasingly summarized form, providing little infomiation on how or when the techniqueswere applied
during an interrogation. There aie also few CIA records detailing the rendition process for detainees and their
transportation to or between detention sites. CIA records do include detainee comments on their rendition

experiences and photographs of detainees in the process of being transported. Based on a review of the
photographs, detainees transported by the CIA by aircraft were typically hooded with their hands and feet shackled.
The detainees wore large headsets to eliminate their ability to hear, and these headsets were typically affixed to a
detainee's head with duct tape that ran the circumferenceof the detainee's head. CIA detainees were placed in
diapers and not permitted to use the lavatory on the aircraft. Depending on the aircraft, detainees were either
strapped into seats during the flights, or laid down and strapped to the floor of the plane horizontally like cargo. See
CIA photographs of renditions among CIA materials provided to the Committee pursuant to the Committee's
document requests, as well as CIA detainee reviews in Volume III for additional information on the transport of CIA
detainees.

CIA's chief interrogator.^^- As late as June 2003, SWIGERT and DUNBAR, operating outside
of the direct management of the Renditions Group, were deployed to DETENTION SITE BLUE

to both interrogate and conduct psychological reviews of detainees.^^^ The dispute extended to
interrogation practices. The Renditions Group's leadership considered the waterboard, which
Chief of Interrogations
was not certified to use, as "life threatening," and
complained to the OIG that some CIA officers in the Directorate of Operations believed that, as a

result, the Renditions Group was "running a 'sissified' inten'ogation program."^^"^ At the same

time, CIA CTC personnel criticized the Renditions Group and^|^H for their use of painful
stress positions, as well as for the conditions at DETENTION SITE COBALT.-^^''

(i:!8y'^|||||[|H|||HH||||//NF) There were also concerns about possible conflicts ofinterest
related to the conti'actors, SWIGERT and DUNBAR. On January 30, 2003, a cable from CIA

Headquarters stated that "the individual at the interrogation site who administers the techniques
is not the same person who issues the psychological assessment of record," and that only a staff

psychologist, nota contractor, could issue an assessment of record."^^^ In June 2003, however,
SWIGERT and DUNBAR were deployed to DETENTION SITE BLUE to interrogate KSM, as
well as to assess KSM's "psychological stability" and "resistance posture.As described later
in this summary, the contractors had earlier subjected KSM to the waterboard and other CIA
enhanced interrogation techniques. The decision to send the contract psychologists to
DETENTION SITE BLUE prompted an OMS psychologist to write to OMS leadership that

"remind him that there are differing consequences for cooperating or not cooperating."-^^^ In his

[SWIGERT] and [DUNBAR], however, the appearance of impropriety continued, albeit to a lesser degree, because
they were occasionally asked to provide input to assessments on detainees whom they had not interrogated"

CIA to DETENTION SITE COBALT inCountry | on November 2002, where he was held
for H days before being transferred to DETENTION SITE GREEN on November 2002.*^^^
At DETENTION SITE GREEN, al-Nashiri was interrogated using the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques, including being subjected to the waterboard at least three times.In
December 2002, when DETENTION SITE GREEN was closed, al-Nashiri and Abu Zubaydah
were rendered to DETENTION SITE BLUE.^^^

(T8^^H|||||mi||||||/^NF) In total, al-Nashiri was subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques during at least four separate periods, with each period typically ending

with an assessment from on-site interrogators that al-Nashiri was compliant and cooperative.^^^

Officers atCIAHeadquai^ disagreed with these assessments, with the deputy chief ofALEC
Station,
commenting that DETENTION SITE BLUE interrogators should
not make "sweeping statements" in cable traffic regarding al-Nashiri's compliance.Officers
at CIA Headquarters sought to reinstate the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques
based on their belief that al-Nashiri had not yet provided actionable intelligence on imminent
attacks.

Shortly after al-Nashiri arrived at DETENTION SITE BLUE, CIA
interrogators at the detention site judged al-Nashiri's cooperation and compliance by his
engagement and willingness to answer questions, while CIA Headquarters personnel judged his
compliance based on the specific actionable intelligence he had provided (or the lack thereof).
For example, in December 2002, interrogators informed CIA Headquarters that al-Nashiri was
"cooperative and truthful," and that the "consensus" at the detention site was that al-Nashiri was

"a compliant detainee" who was not "withholding important thi'eat information."^'^^ Officers
from the CIA's ALEC Station at CL\ Headquarters responded:
"it is inconceivable to us that al-Nashiri cannot provide us concrete leads....
When we are able to capture other terrorists based on his leads and to thwart
future plots based on his reporting, we will have much more confidence that he
is, indeed, genuinely cooperative on some level."^"^^
Later, after multiple follow-up debriefings, DETENTION SITE

BLUE officers again wrote that they had "reluctantly concluded" that al-Nashiri was providing
"logical and rational explanations" to questions provided by CIA Headquarters and therefore
they recommended "against resuming enhanced measures" unless ALEC Station had evidence
al-Nashiri was lying.^"^^ A cable from the detention site stated:
"without tangible proof of lying or intentional withholding, however, we
believe employing enhanced measures will accomplish nothing except show
[al-Nashiri] that he will be punished whether he cooperates or not, thus eroding
any remaining desire to continue cooperating.... [The] bottom line is that we
think [al-Nashiri] is being cooperative, and if subjected to indiscriminate and
prolonged enhanced measures, there is a good chance he will either fold up and
cease cooperation, or suffer the sort of permanent mental harm prohibited by
the statute. Therefore, a decision to resume enhanced measures must be

grounded in fact and not general feelings."^"^

the chief of RDG^"^^â^theentimhat managed the CIA's Detention and

because he "had not been through the interrogation training" and because

techniques on al-Nashiri shortly thereafter, despite the fact tiiat

[CIA OFFICER 2]

had not been trained, certified, or approved to use the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.
[CIA OFFICER 2] wrote in a cable to CIA Headquarters that "[al]-Nashiri responds
well to harsh treatment" and suggested that the interrogators continue to administer "various
degrees of mild punishment," but still allow for "a small degree of 'hope,' by introducing some
'minute rewards.

[CIA OFFICER 2], with the permission and participation of the DETENTION SITE

BLUE chief ofBase, who also had not been trained and qualified as an intemjgato^sed a series
of unauthorized interrogation techniques against al-Nashiri. For example,

head" for approximately two and ahalfdays^^^M^ater, during the course of al-Nashiri's

Based on a report from CTC, the CIA Office of Inspector General
conducted a review of these interrogation incidents, and issued a report of investigation in the

fall of 2003.^^^ The Office ofInspector General later described additional allegations of
unauthorized techniques used against al-Nashiri by

[CIA OFFICER 2] and other

interrogators, including slapping al-Nashiri multiple times on the back of the head during
inten'ogations; implying that his mother would be brought before him and sexually abused;
blowing cigar smoke in al-Nashiri's face; giving al-Nashiri a forced bath using a stiff brush; and
using improvised stress positions that caused cuts and bruises resulting in the intervention of a
medical officer, who was concerned that al-Nashiri's shoulders would be dislocated using the

stress positions.^^^ When interviewed by the Office of Inspector General, the DETENTION
SITE BLUE chief ofBas^t^d he did not object to using the gun and drill in the interrogations
because he believed
[CIA OFFICER 2] was sent from CIA Headquarters "to resolve
the matter of al-Nashiri's cooperation" and that he believed

permission to use the interrogation techniques.^^'^ The chief of Base added that his own on-site

On January
2003, CIA contractor DUNBAR arrived at
DETENTION SITE BLUE to conduct a "Psychological Interrogation Assessment" to judge alNashiri's suitability for the additional use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and
develop recommendations for his interrogation. The resulting interrogation plan proposed that
the interrogators would have the "latitude to use the full range of enhanced exploitation and

interrogation measures," adding that "the use of the water board would require additional support
from" fellow CIA contractor Grayson SWIGERT. According to the interrogation plan, once the
interrogators had eliminated al-Nashiri's "sense of control and predictability" and established a
"desired level of helplessness," they would reduce the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation

techniques and transition to a debriefing phase once again.^^^

(T!S^|H||H^^^^^^JF)After receiving the proposed interrogation plan for al-Nashiri on
January2l720037^HHBBB' CIA's chief of interrogationsâwhose presence had

previously prompted al-Nashiri to tremble in fear^^"^âemailed CIA colleagues to notify them that

he had "informed the front office of CTC" that he would "no longer be associated in any way

with the interrogation progi'am due to serious reservation[s] [he had]abo^he current state of
affairs" and would instead be "retiring shortly." In the same email,

wrote, "[t]his is a

train wreak [sic] waiting to happen and I intend to get the hell offthe train before it happens."^^^
HH drafted a cable for CIA Headquarters to send to DETENTION SITE BLUE raising a
number of concerns that he, the chief of interrogations, believed should be "entered for the
record." The CIA Headquarters cableâwhich does not appear to have been disseminated to
DETENTION SITE BLUEâincluded the foUowing:

"we have serious reservations with the continued use of enhanced techniques
with [al-Nashiri] and its long term impact on him. [Al-Nashiri] has been held

for three months in very difficult conditions, both physically and mentally. It
is the assessment of the prior inteiTOgators that [al-Nashiri] has been mainly
truthful and is not withholding significant information. To continue to use
enhanced technique[s] without clear indications that he [is] withholding
important info is excessive and may cause him to cease cooperation on any
level. [Al-Nashiri] may come to the conclusion that whether he cooperates or
not, he will continually be subjected to enhanced techniques, therefore, what is

the incentive for continued cooperation. Also, both C/CTC/R^^hief ofCTC

RDG

and HVT Inter^ator [|^H^^H] who

departed [DETENTION SITE BLUE] in J[(january, believe continued

enhanced methods may push [al-Nashiri] over the edge psychologically."^^Â®

The draft cable from

also raised "conflict of

responsibility" concerns, stating:

"Another area of concern is the use of the psychologist as an interrogator. The
role of the ops psychologist is to be a detached observer and serve as a check
on the interrogator to prevent the interrogator from any unintentional excess of

pressure which might cause permanent psychologicalharm to the subject. The
medical officer is on hand to provide the same protection from physical actions
that might harm the subject. Therefore, the medical officer and the
psychologist should not serve as an interrogator, which is a conflict of

responsibility. We note that [th^ropose^lan] contains a psychological
interrogation assessment by
psychologist [DUNBAR] which
is to be carried out by interrogator [DUNBAR]. We have a problem with him
conducting both roles simultaneously."^^'
Rather than releasing the cable that was drafted by
CIA
Headquarters approved a plan to reinstitute the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques against al-Nashiri, beginning with shaving him, removing his clothing, and placing
him in a standing sleep deprivation position with his aims affixed over his head.^^^ CIA cables
describing subsequent interrogations indicate that al-Nashiri was nude and, at times, "put in the

standing position, handcuffed and shackled."^^^ According to cables, CIA interrogators decided
to provide al-Nashiri clothes to "hopefully stabilize his physiological symptoms and prevent

them from deteriorating,"^^ noting in a cable the next day that al-Nashiri was suffering from a
head cold which caused his body to shake for approximately ten minutes during an
interrogation. 365
Beginning in June 2003, the CIA transferred al-Nashiri to five

different CIA detention facilities before he was transferred to U.S. military custody on

September 5, 2006.^^^ In the interim, he was diagnosed by some CIA psychologists as having
"anxiety" and "major depressive" disorder,^^^ while others found no symptoms of either

Over a period of years, al-Nashiri accused the CIA staff of drugging or poisoning his

food, and complained of bodily pain and insomnia.^^^ At one point, al-Nashiri launched a short
lived hunger strike that resulted in the CIA force feeding him rectally.^^^
October 2004, 21 months after the final documented use of the

CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against al-Nashiri, an assessment by CIA contract
interrogator DUNBAR and another CIA interrogator concluded that al-Nashiri provided
"essentially no actionable information," and that "the probability that he has much more to
contribute is low."^^^ Over the course of al-Nashiri's detention and interrogation by the CIA, the
CIA disseminated 145 intelligence reports based on his debriefings. Al-Nashiri provided
information on past operational plotting, associates whom he expected to participate in plots,
details on completed operations, and background on al-Qa'ida's structure and methods of

operation.^^^ Al-Nashiii did notprovide the information that the CIA's ALEC Station sought
and believed al-Nashiri possessed, specifically "perishable threat information to help [CIA]

F. The Detention and InteiTogation of Ramzi Bin Al-Shibh
1. Ramzi Bin Al-Shibh Provides Information While in Foreign Government Custody, Prior
to Rendition to CIA Custody
September 15, 2001, Ramzi bin al-Shibh was assessed
by the CIA to be a facilitator for the September 11, 2001, attacksand an associate of the 9/11

hijackers.^^^ While targeting another terrorist, Hassan Ghul, Hjj^l Pakistani officials

unexpectedly captured bin al-Shibh during raids in Pakistan on Septemberll^2002.^^Â® On
September |||, 2002, bin al-Shibh was rendered to aforeign government,
Approximately five months later, on February |, 2003, bin al-Shibh was rendered from the

custody of

to CIA custody, becoming the 41Â®' CIA detainee.^^^

As with Abu Zubaydah and 'Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, personnel at
CIA Headquarters- -often in ALEC Stationâoverestimated the information bin al-Shibh would
have access to within al-Qa'ida, writing that bin al-Shibh "likely has critical information on

upcoming attacks and locations of senior al-Qa'ida operatives."^^^ Later, after bin al-Shibh was
interrogated using the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques for an estimated 34 days, the
CIA's ALEC Station concluded that bin al-Shibh was not a senior member of al-Qa'ida and was

not in a position to know details about al-Qa'ida's plans for future attacks.In another parallel,
officers at CIA Headquarters requested and directed the continued use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques against bin al-Shibh when CIA detention site personnel recommended

ending such measures.^^^

Ramzi bin al-Shibh was initially interrogated by a foreign

government,^^^ While officers at CIA Headquarters were dissatisfied with the intelligence
production from his five months of detention in foreign governmentcustody, CIA officers in that
country were satisfied with bin al-Shibh's reporting.^^^ Those CIA officers wrote that bin alShibh had provided information used in approximately 50 CIA intelligence reports, including
information on potential fiiture threats, to include a potential attack on London's Heathrow

Airport an^^Nashiri's planning for potential operations in the Arabian Peninsula. The CIA
officers

[in-country] also noted that they found bin al-Shibh's information to be generally

accurate and that they "found few cases wherehe^enly/clearly misstated facts.In a cable
to CIA Headquarters, the CIA officers in IHHH
country where Ramzi bin al-Shibh was
being held] concluded, "overall, he provided what was needed." The same cable stated that bin

al-Shibh's interrogation was similar to other interrogations they had participated in, and that the
most effective interrogation tool was having information available to confront him when he tried

to mislead or provide incomplete information.^^^ Personnel at CIA Headquarters concluded in
2005 that the most significantintelligence derived from bin al-Shibh was obtained during his
detention in foreign government custody, which was prior to his rendition to CIA custody and
the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation technique

2. Interrogation Plan for Ramzi Bin Al-Shibh Proposes Immediate Use of Nudity and
Shackling with Hands Above the Head; Plan Becomes Templatefor Future Detainees
Despite the aforementioned assessments from CIA officers in

conce^ng bin al-Shibh's cooperation, officers atCIA Headquarters decided the CIA
should obtain m custody ofbin al-Shibh and render him to DETENTION SITE BLUE in
Country
On February |, 2003, in anticipationofbinal-Shi^ arrival, inten-ogators at the
detention site, led by the CIA's chief interrogator,

prepared an interrogation plan

for bin al-Shibh.'^Â®^ The plan became a template, and subsequent requests to CIA Headquarters

The interrogation plan proposed that immediately following the
psychological and medical assessments conducted upon his arrival, bin al-Shibh would be

subjected to "sensory dislocation.'"^^ The proposed sensory dislocation included shaving bin alShibh's head and face, exposing him to loud noise in a white room with white lights, keeping
him "unclothed and subjected to uncomfortably cool temperatures," and shackling him "hand
and foot with arms outstretched over his head (with his feet firmly on the floor and not allowed

to support his weight with his arms).'""^'' Contrary to CIA representations made later to the
Committee that detainees were always offered the opportunity to cooperate before being
subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, the plan stated that bin al-Shibh would
be shackled nude with his arms overhead in a cold room prior to any discussion with

interrogators or any assessment of his level of cooperation."^*^^ According to a cable, only after
the interrogators determined that his "initial resistance level [had] been diminished by the

conditions" would the questioning and interrogation phase begin."^^^
The interrogation phase described in the plan included near
constant interrogations, as well as continued sensory deprivation, a liquid diet, and sleep
deprivation. In addition, the interrogation plan stated that the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques would be used, including the "attention grasp, walling, the facial hold, the facial
slap... the abdominal slap, cramped confinement, wall standing, stress positions, sleep
deprivation beyond 72 hours, and the waterboard, as appropriate to [bin al-Shibh's] level of
resistance.

Based on versions of this interrogation plan, at least six detainees
were stripped and shackled nude, placed in the standing position for sleep deprivation, or
subjected to other CIA enhanced interrogation techniques prior to being questioned by an

inteiTogator in 2003."^Â®^ Five of these detainees were shackled naked in the standing position

3. CIA Headquarters Urges Continued Use of the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation
Techniques, Despite Interrogators' Assessment That Ramzi Bin Al-Shibh Was
Cooperative

When CIA interrogators at DETENTION SITE BLUE assessed

that bin al-Shibh was cooperative and did not have additional knowledge of future attacks,
CIA Headquarters disagreed and instructed the interrogators to continue using the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques, which failed to elicit the information sought by CIA

Headquarters.'*^^ On February 11, 2003, interrogators asked CIA Headquarters for questions that
ALEC Station was "85 percentcertain [bin al-Shibh ] will be able to answer," in order to verify
bin al-Shibh's level of cooperation.'*^'* The interrogators stated that information from Abu
Zubaydah and al-Nashiri suggested that bin al-Shibh would not have been given a new
assignment or trusted with significant information given his high-profile links to the September

11, 2001, attacks."*^^ They further stated that bin al-Shibh had "achieved substantial notoriety
after 11 September," but was still unproven in al-Qa'ida circles and may have "been privy to
information more as a bystander than as an active participant."'*^^
The CIA's ALEC Station disagreed with the assessment of the

detention site personnel, responding that it did not believe the portrayals of bin al-Shibh offered
by Abu Zubaydah and al-Nashiri were accurate and that CIA Headquarters assessed that bin alShibh must have actionable information due to his proximity to KSM and CIA Headquarters'
belief that bin al-Shibh had a history of withholding information from interrogators. ALEC
Station wrote:

"As base [DETENTION SITE BLUE] is well aware, Ramzi had long
been deliberately withholding and/or providing misleading information to
his interrogators in [a foreign government].... From our optic, it is
imperative to focus Ramzi exclusively on two issues: 1) What are the
next attacks planned for the US and 2) Who and where are the operatives
inside the United States.'"*'^

The ALEC Station cable stated that bin al-Shibh had ''spent
extensive time with [KSM]," and "must have heard discussions of other targets." The cable

added that "HQS strongly believes that Binalshibh was involved in efforts on behalf of KSM to
identify and place operatives in the West." The February 13, 2003, cable concluded:
"We think Binalshibh is uniquely positioned to give us much needed
critical information to help us thwart large-scale attacks inside the United
States, and we want to do our utmost to get it as soon as possible. Good
luck."4i8
CIA officers at DETENTION SITE BLUE therefore continued to

use the CIA's enhanced inten'ogation techniques against bin al-Shibh for approximately three
additional weeks after this exchange, including sleep deprivation, nudity, dietary manipulation,

facial holds, attention grasps, abdominal slaps, facial slaps, and walling.'^^^ Bin al-Shibh did not
provide the information sought on "operatives inside the United States" or "large-scale attacks

Ramzi bin al-Shibh was subjected to interrogation techniques and

conditions of confinement that were not approved by CIA Headquarters. CIA inten-ogators used
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques for behavior adjustment purposes, in response to
perceived disrespect, and on several occasions, before bin al-Shibh had an opportunity to
respond to an inten'ogator's questions or before a question was asked. The CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques were applied when bin al-Shibh failed to address an interrogator as
"sir," when inteiTogators noted bin al-Shibh had a "blank stare" on his face, and when bin al-

Shibh complained of stomach pain.'^^^ Further, despite CIA policy at the time to keep detainees
under constant light for security purposes, bin al-Shibh was kept in total darkness to heighten his
sense of fear."^^^

CIA psychological assessments of bin al-Shibh were slow to

recognize the onset of psychological problems brought about, according to later CIA
assessments, by bin al-Shibh's long-term social isolation and his anxiety that the CIA would
return to using its enhanced inten"ogation techniques against him. The symptoms included

visions, paranoia, insomnia, and attempts at self-harm."^^"^ In April 2005, a CIA psychologist
stated that bin al-Shibh "has remained in social isolation" for as long as two and half years and
the isolation was having a "clear and escalating effect on his psychological functioning." The
officer continued, "in [bin al-Shibh's] case, it is important to keep in mind that he was previously
a relatively high-functioning individual, making his deterioration over the past several months

more alarming.'"^^^ The psychologist wrote, "significant alterations to RBS'[s] detention
environment must occur soon to prevent further and more serious psychological disturbance.
On September 5, 2006, bin al-Shibh was transferred to U.S. military custody at Guantanamo

Bay, Cuba."^^^ After his arrival, bin al-Shibh was placed on anti-psychotic medications.'^"'^

al-Shibh's cell and that "[w]hen security personnel anived to replace the bulb, bin al-Shibh was cowering in the

"Much of [bin al-Shibh's] statements on the 11 September attacks have been

speculative, and many of the details could be found in media accounts of the
attacks that appeared before he was detained. In the few instances where his
reporting was unique and plausible, we cannot verify or refute the
information... he has been sketchy on some aspects of the 9/11 plot, perhaps in
order to downplay his role in the plot. His information on individuals is non
specific; he has given us nothing on the Saudi hijackers or others who played a

role... The overall quality of his reporting has steadily declined since 2003.'"^^^

The capture of KSM was attributable to a single CIA source who

led the CIA and Pakistan authorities directly to KSM. KSM was held in Pakistani

custody from the time ofhis capture on March 1, 2003, to March |, 2003, and was interrogated
by CIA officers and Pakistani officials. According to CIA records, while in Pakistani custody,
KSM was subjected to some sleep deprivation, but there are no indications of other coercive

interrogation techniques being used.'^^^ While KSM denied knowledge of attack plans and the
locations of Usama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri,'^^'^ he did provide limited information on
various al-Qa'ida leaders and operatives who had already been captured. KSM's willingness to
discuss operatives when confronted with information about their captureâbehavior noted by
CIA officers on-site in Pakistanâwas a recurring theme throughout KSM's subsequent detention
and inten-ogation in CIA custody

Less than two hours after KSM's capturc^nticipa^g KSM's
arrival at DETENTION SITE COBALT, the chief ofinterrogations, BHIHI' sent an email
to CIA Headquarters with the subject line, "Let's roll with the new guy." The email requested

2003.) On April 3, 2003,an IICT analysis stated thatKSM "likelyjudges that information related to Sufaatabeady
has been compromised since his arrest." (See "KhalidShaykh Muhammad's Tlireat Reporting - Precious Truths,

Sur^nded by a Bodyguard ofLies," IICT, April 3, 2003.) CIA analysis from 2005 stated that
[a foreign government holding Sufaat] was likely to have known details of Yazid's involvement in al-

Qa'ida's anthrax program by early 2002," although that information was not provided at the time to the CIA. (See

captured and detained by the CIA. Whilebeing subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques he
changed his description of al-Qa'ida's anthrax efforts multiple times. On August 1, 2003, Abu Bakr al-Filistini, also
known as Samr al-Barq, told CIA interrogators that "we never made anthrax." At the time, he was being subjected
to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and was told that the harsh treatment would not stop until he "told

the truth." According to cables, crying, al-Barq then said "I made the anthrax." Asked if he was lying, al-Barq said

2. The CIA Transfers KSM to DETENTIONSITE BLUE, Anticipates Use of the Waterboard

Within hours of KSM's capture, ALEC Station successfully argued
that CIA contractors SWIGERT and DUNBAR should take over the interrogation of KSM upon

KSM's arrival at DETENTION SITE BLUE.^^ On March 3, 2003, CIA Headquarters approved
an interrogation plan indicating that KSM "will be subjected to immediate interrogation
techniques," and that "the interrogation techniques will increase in intensity from standard to
that he was. After CIA intenogators "demonstrated the penalty for lying," al-Barq again sUitedth^'I made the
anthrax" and then immediately recanted, and then again stated that he made anthrax. {See

enhanced techniques commensurate with [KSM's] level of resistance, until he indicates initial

cooperation."^'^^ On March |, 2003, the day ofKSM's amval atDETENTION SITE BLUE, the
on-site medical officer described the use of the waterboard on KSM as inevitable;

"[T]he team here apparently looks to use the water board in two different

contexts. One is as a tool of regression and control in which it is used up front
and aggressively. The second is to vet information on an as needed basis.

Given the various pressures from home vs what is happening on the ground, I
think the team's expectation is that [KSM] will [be] getting treatment
somewhere in between. I don't think they believe that it will be possible to
entirely avoid the water board given the high and immediate threat to US and
allied interests. It is an interesting dynamic because they are weU aware of the
toll it will take on the team vs. the detainee. The requirements coming from
home are really unbelievable in terms of breadth and detail.'"^^^
Meanwhile, OMS completed draft guidelines on the use of the

CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, specifically addressing the waterboard interrogation
technique. These guidelines were sent to the medical personnel at the detention site. The
guidelines included a warning that the risk of the waterboard was "directly related to number of
exposures and may well accelerate as exposures increase," that concerns about cumulative

effects would emerge after three to five days, and that there should be an upper limit on the total
number of waterboard exposures, "perhaps 20 in a week." CIA records indicate that, as of the
day of KSM's arrival at DETENTION SITE BLUE, the interrogation team had not reviewed the

draft OMS guidelines."^^KSM arrived at DETENTION SITE BLUE at approximately 6:00

PM local time on March |, 2003, and was immediately stripped and placed in the standing sleep
deprivation position."^^^ At6:38 PM, after the medical and psychological personnel who had
traveled with KSM from DETENTION SITE COBALT cleared KSM for the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques, the detention site requested CIA Headquarters' approval to begin the

interrogation process."^^"^ The detention site received the approvals at 7:18 PM,"^^^ at which point
the interrogators began using the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on KSM."^^^

On March

Headquarters conveying the views of the CIA's Deputy Director of Operations James Pavitt on

the inteiTOgation of KSM.'^^^ Pavitt latertold the inspector general that he "did notrecall
specifically ordering that a detainee be waterboarded right away," but he "did not discount that
possibility." According to records of the interview, "Pavitt did recall saying, 'I want to know
what he knows, and I want to know it fast,""^^^ The on-site medical officer later wrote in an

more or less demanding that it be used early and often.'"^^'^

more than anticipated in the Office of Legal Counsel's August 1, 2002, opinion), was followed

medical officer from reporting on the interrogation directly to OMS outside of official CIA cable
traffic^^^

March 12, 2003, KSM provided information on the Heathrow
Airport and Canary Wharf plotting. KSM stated that he showed a sketch in his notebook of a
building in Canary Wharf (a major business district in London) to Ammar al-Baluchi.'^^^ He also
provided statements about directing prospective pilots to study at flight schools,and stated that
Jaffar al-Tayyar was involved in the Heathrow Plot."^^^ KSM retracted all of this information

laterin his detention.'^^^ There are no CIA records indicating that these and other retractions
were assessed to be false.

The March 12, 2003, reporting from KSM on the Heathrow Airport
plotting was deemed at the time by CIA interrogators to be an effort by KSM to avoid discussion
of plotting inside the United States and thus contributed to the decision to subject KSM to two

waterboarding sessions that day."^^' During these sessions, KSM ingested a significant amount of
water. CIA records state that KSM's "abdomen was somewhat distended and he expressed water

when the abdomen was pressed.'"^^^ KSM's gastric contents were so diluted by water that the
medical officer present was "not concerned about regurgitated gastric acid damaging KSM's
esophagus.The officer was, however, concerned about water intoxication and dilution of

electrolytes and requested that the interroga^s use saline in future waterboarding sessions.

The medical officer later wrote to ^^H^I^MS that KSM was "ingesting and aspiration [sic]
a LOT of water," and that "[i]n the new technique we are basically doing a series of near

drownings.'"^^^ During the day, KSM was also subjected to the attention grasp, insult slap,
abdominal slap, and walling."^^^
March 13, 2003, after KSM again denied that al-Qa'ida had

operations planned for inside the United States, CIA interrogators decided on a "day of intensive

waterboard sessions.'"^^^ During the first of three waterboarding sessions that day, interrogators
responded to KSM's efforts to breathe during the sessions by holding KSM's lips and directing

the water at his mouth."^^^ According to a cablefrom thedetention site, KSM "would begin
signaling by pointing upward with his two index fingers as the water pouring approached the
established time limit." The cable noted that "[t]his behavior indicates that the subject remains

alert and has become familiar with key aspects of the process.CIA records state that KSM
"yelled and twisted" when he was secured to the waterboard for the second session of the day,
but "appeared resigned to tolerating the board and stated he had nothing new to say" about

terrorist plots inside the United States."^^^
Prior to the third waterboard session of that calendar day, the onsite medical officer raised concerns that the waterboard sessionâwhich would be the fourth in

14 hoursâwould exceed the limits included in draft OMS guidelines that had been distributed

the previous aftemoon."^^^ Those draft guidelines stated that up to three waterboard sessions in a
24-hour period was acceptable.'^'^^ At the time, KSM had been subjected to more than 65
applications of water during the four waterboarding sessions between the afternoon of March 12,
2003, and the morning of March 13, 2003. In response to a request for approval from the chief
of Base, CTC attorney
assured detention site personnel that the medical officer

"is incorrect that these guidelines have been approved and/or fully coordinated.""^^^
sent an email to the detention site authorizing the additional waterboai*ding session."^^"^ Despite
indications from
that the detention site personnel would receive a formal authorizing
cable, no such authorization from CIA Headquarters was provided. At the end of the day, the

medical officer wrote ^HmOMS that "[tjhings are slowly evolving form [sic] OMS being
viewed as the institutional conscience and the limiting factor to the ones who are dedicated to
maximizing the benefit in a safe manner and keepingeveryone's butt out of trouble." The

medical officer noted that his communication with jl^HlOMS was no longer "viewed with
suspicion.On the afternoon of March 13, 2003, KSM was subjected to his third waterboard
session of that calendar day and fifth in 25 hours. CIA records note that KSM vomited during
and after the procedure.

Shortly thereafter, CIA Headquarters began reevaluating the use of
the waterboard interrogation technique. According to a March 14, 2003, email from an
interrogator who was not at DETENTION SITE BLUE, but was reviewing cable traffic, the
"[ojverall view seems to be" that the waterboard "is not working in gaining KSM['s]

compliance.'"^^^ The deputy chief of the CIA interrogation program responded in agreement,
adding that "[a]gainst KSM it has proven ineffective," and that "[t]he potential for physical harm
is far greater with the waterboard than with the other techniques, bringing into question the issue
of risk vs. gain...." The deputy chief further suggested that the waterboard was
counterproductive, stating that "[w]e seem to have lost ground" with KSM since progress made
at DETENTION SITE COBALT, and as a result, the CIA should "consider the possibility" that
the introduction of the waterboard interrogation technique "may poison the well.""^^^ The email
in which these sentiments were expressed was sent to
the CTC attorney
overseeing the interrogation of KSM. Despite these reservations and assessments, the

waterboarding of KSM continued for another 10 days.'^'^^
On March 15, 2003, KSM was waterboarded for failing to confirm
references in signals intercepts on al-Qa'ida's efforts to obtain "nuclear suitcases.
Subsequent signals intercepts and information from a foreign government would later indicate
that the nuclear suitcase threat was an orchestrated scam."^^^ KSM was waterboarded a second

time that day after failing to provide information on operations against the United States or on al-

QaMda nuclear capabilities."^^^ During the waterboarding sessions that day, the application of the
interrogation technique further evolved, with the interrogators now using their hands to maintain
a one-inch deep "pool" of water over KSM's nose and mouth in an effort to make it impossible

for KSM to ingest all the water being poured."^^^ At one point, SWIGERT and DUNBAR waited
for KSM to talk before pouring water over his mouth.

exchanged emails with the medical officer

at DETENTION SITE BLUE on the waterboarding of KSM. According to

the

waterboard inten'ogation technique had "moved even further from the SERE model.'"^^^
also wrote:

"Truthfully, though, I don't recall that the WB [waterboard] produced anything
actionable in AZ [Abu Zubaydah] any earlier than another technique might
have. This may be different with KSM, but that is still as much a statement of
faith as anything else - since we don't seem to study the question as we go...
it's been many more days of constant WB repetitions, with the evidence of
progress through most of them not being actionable intel but rather that 'he
looks like he's weakening.' The WB may actually be the best; just don't like

to base it on religion.'"^^^
On March 18, 2003, KSM was confronted with the reporting of

Majid Khan, who was then in thecustody of a foreign government,"^^^ regarding plotting against
gas stations inside the United States, information that KSM had not previously discussed. In
assessing the session, DETENTION SITE BLUE personnel noted that "KSM will selectively lie,
provide partial truths, and misdirect when he believes he will not be found out and held

for checking his responses.
The same day, KSM provided additional information on the

Heathrow Airport plotting, much of which he would recant in 2004."^^^ KSM also discussed
Jaffar al-Tayyar again, prompting the detention site personnel to refer to the "all-purpose" alTayyar whom KSM had "woven... into practically every story, each time with a different

role."^Â°Â° After KS^^iad included al-Tayyar in his discussion of Majid Khan's gas station plot,

KSM debriefer
in email that "[t]oday [al-Tayyar's] working with Majid
Khan, yesterday the Londoncrowd, the day before Padilla - you get the point."^^^ Beginning the
evening of March 18, 2003, KSM began a period of sleep deprivation, most of it in the standing
position, which would last for seven and a half days, or approximately 180 hours.^Â®On March 19, 2003, the interrogators at the detention site decided

to waterboard KSM due to KSM's inconsistent information about Jaffar al-Tayyar's passport.^^^
According to CIA cables, after assuming his position on the waterboard, KSM "seemed to lose
control" and appeared "somewhat frantic," stating diat he "had been forced to lie, and ma[k]e up
stories about" Jaffar al-Tayyar because of his interrogators.KSM then stated that his
reporting on al-Tayyar's role in Majid Khan's plotting was a "complete fabrication" and that alTayyar had been compromised as an operative and that as a result, al-Tayyar could not be used

for a terrorist operation.^"^ In response, the interrogators told KSM that they only wanted tohear

hin^p^ ifhe was revealing information on the next attack.^Â®^ Deputy Chief of ALEC Station
later told the inspector general that it was around this time that contract interrogator
DUNBAR stated that "he had not seen a 'resistor' [sic] like KSM, and was 'going to go to school

on this guy.'"^^^ According to CIA records, the interrogators then "devote[d] all measures to
pressuring [KSM] on the single issue of the 'next attack on America,"' including attention grabs,
insult slaps, walling, water dousing, and additional waterboard sessions.

and walling."^Â®^ KSM was described as "[t]ired and sore," with abrasions on his ankles, shins,
and wrists, as well as on the back of his head.^'Â® He also suffered from pedal edema resulting
from extended standing.^^^ Afterhaving concluded that there was "no further movement" in the
interrogation, the detention site personnel hung a picture of KSM's sons in his cell as a way to

"[heighten] his imagination concerning where they are, who has them, [and] what is in store for
them."^^2

The waterboarding of KSM on March 21, 2003, and March 22,
2003, was based on a misreading of intelligence provided by Majid Khan bvDeputyChief of
ALEC Station
According to a cable from the CIA's
Khan,
who was in foreign government custody, had stated that KSM wanted to use "two to three
unknown Black American Muslim converts who were currently training in Afghanistan," to
"conduct attacks" on gas stations in the United States, and that "KSM was interested in usin^
anyone with US status to assist with this operation.Upon receipt of this reporting,
wrote in an email "i love the Black American Muslim at AQ camps in Afghanuistan [sic] ...

Mukie [KSM] is going to be hatin' life on this one."^^"^ However, her subsequent questioning of
KSM was not based on Khan's actual reporting, which was about potential operatives already in
Afghanistan, but rather something Khan had not saidâthat KSM directed him to make contact

with African-American converts in the United States.^^^ According to CIA records, in a
"contentious" session that lasted for hours and involved the use of the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques, KSM "flatly denied" any efforts to recruit African-American Muslim

converts, KSM was then waterboarded.^'^ Later in the day, facing the threat of a second
waterboarding session, KSM "relented and said that maybe he had told Khan that he should see
if he could make contact with members of the Black American Muslim convert community."

The CIA interrogators then returned KSM to the standing sleep deprivation position without a

second waterboarding session.^^^
The next day, March 22, 2003, interrogators subjected KSM to
"intense" questioning and walling, but when KSM provided no new information on AfricanAmerican Muslim converts or threats inside the United States, he was subjected to additional

waterboarding.^^^ An hour later, KSM stated that he was "ready to talk."^^^ He told the CIA
interrogators that he had sent Abu Issa al-Britani to Montana to recruit African-American

Muslim converts, a mission he said had been prompted by discussions with a London-based

shaykh whose bodyguards had families in Montana.^^Â® KSM also stated that he tasked Majid
Khan with attending Muslim conferences in the United States to "spot and assess potential
extremists" who would assist in the gas stationplot.^^^ In June 2003, KSM admitted that he
fabricated the story about Abu Issa al-Britani and Montana, explaining that he was "under
'enhanced measures' when he made these claims and simply told his interrogators what he

thought they wanted to hear."^^^ In August 2003, KSM reiterated that hehad no plans torecruit
or use "black American Muslim" converts operationallyIn December 2005, he denied ever
asking Majid Khan to recruit converts or attend Islamic conferences.^^"^
On March 24, 2003, KSM underwent his fifteenth and final

documented waterboarding sessiondue to his "intransigence" in failing to identify suspected
Abu Bakr al-Azdi operations in the United States, and for having "lied about poison and

biological warfare programs."^^^ KSM was described in the session as being "composed, stoic,
and resigned."^^^
That evening, the detention site received two reports. The first
recounted the reporting of Majid Khan, who was still in the custody of a foreign govermnent, on
Uzhair, who ran the New York branch of his father's Karachi-based import-export business, and

on Uzhair's father/''-^ According to Khan, his meetings with the two were facilitated by Ammar
al-Baluchi.^^^ The second report described the reporting of lyman Paris, who was in FBI
custody, on a plot to cut the suspension cables on the Brooklyn Bridge and exploration of plans
to derail trains and conduct an attackin Washington, D.C.^-^ KSM, whomdetention site

personnel described as "boxed in" by the new reporting,^^Â® then stated that Uzhair's father, Sayf
al-Rahman Paracha, had agreed to smuggle explosives into the United States.^^^ As described
10941 (221506Z MAR 03); â¢â¢â¢

10950 (222127Z MAR 03). One cable from DETENTION

SITE BLUE hypothesized that KSM was lying in order to force the CIA interrogators to apply the CIA's enhanced
inteiTogation techniques: "[T]he enhanced measures resulting from his lying in [sic] details could be a resistance
strategy to keep the interrogation from threatening issues... [KSM's] apparent willingness to provoke and incur the
use of enhanced measures mayrepresent a calculated strategy to either: (A) redirect the courseof the interrogation;
or (B)toattempt to cultivate some doubt that he hadknowledge of any current or future operations against the US."

elsewhere in this summary, the purported parties to the agreement denied that such an agreement

existed.''^^ In confirming Paris's reporting, KSM exhibited what the Interagency Intelligence
Committee on Terrorism would later describe as an effort to "stay obvious/general" and "provide
little information that might enable the US to thwart attacks.

With the exception of sleep deprivation, which continued for one

more day, the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogationtechniques against KSM stopped abruptly
on March 24, 2003.^^"^ There are no CIA records directing the interrogation team to cease using
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against KSM, nor any contemporaneous

documentation explaining thedecision.^^^
4. After the Use of the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation Techniques Against KSM Ends, the
CIA Continues to Assess That KSM Is Withholding and Fabricating Information

On April 3, 2003, the Interagency Intelligence Committee on
Ten'orism produced an assessment of KSM's intelligence entitled, "Precious Truths, Surrounded
by a Bodyguard of Lies." The assessment concluded that KSM was withholding or lying about
terrorist plots and operatives targeting the United States. It also identified contradictions
between KSM's reporting on CBRN and other sources.
24, 2003, PBI Director Robert Mueller began seeking
direct PBI access to KSM in order to better understand CIA reporting indicating threats to U.S.

cities.^^^ Despite personal commitments from DCI Tenet to DirectorMueller that access would
be forthcoming, the CIA's CTC successfully formulated a CIA position whereby the FBI would

the CIA nor the FBI knew at the time that the transfer would not occur until September2006.^^^
Between April 2003 and July 2003, KSM frustrated the CIA on a

number of fronts. On May 7, 2003, after more than two months of conflicting reporting, ALEC
Stationconcluded that KSM "consistently wavers" on issues of UBL's location, protectors, and
hosts, and that his information "conveniently lack[s] sufficient detail [to be] actionable

suspicious that KSM is withholding, exaggerating, misdirecting, or outright fabricating

information on CBRN issues."^'^'' At the end of April 2003, KSM was shown pictures of the
recently captured Ammar al-Baluchi and Khallad bin Attash, after which he provided additional

information related to their plotting in Karachi.^"^^ ALEC Station wrote in a May 20, 2003, cable
that "[w]e consider KSM's long-standing omission of [this] information to be a serious concern,
especially as this omission may well have cost American lives had Pakistani authorities not been

and other probable operatives involved in the attack plans."^'^^
May and June 2003, Ammar al-Baluchi and Khallad bin Attash

provided reporting that contradicted KSM's statements about the Heathrow Airport plotting and
included information that KSM had not provided.^"^^ After KSM was confronted with this
reporting, Deputy Chief of ALEC Station

wrote in an email, "OK, that's it...

addition to the FBI, senior CIA officers, including CTC's representatives to the FBI, complained about the

limitations on the dissemination of intelligence derived fromCIA interrogations and the impact those limitations had
on counterterrorism analysis. The CTC's representative to the FBI described this to the OIG as a "serious concern."
He stated that the compartmentation of interrogation information
resulted in
delays in dissemination that could result in information being "missed." He also stated that the CIA's

On April 19, 2003, KSM was questioned for the first time about summer 2002
reporting from Masran bin Arshad, who was in the custody of a foreign government, regarding
the "Second Wave" plot. Informed that bin Arshad had been detained, KSM stated, "I have

forgotten about him, he is notin my mind at all."^"^^ In response, ALEC Station noted that it
"remain[e]d concerned that KSM's progression towards full debriefing status is not yet apparent

where it counts most, in relation to threats to US interests, especially inside CONUS."^"^^ In June
2003, almost three months after the CIA had stopped using its enhanced interrogation techniques

against KSM, senior ALEC Station and RDG officers met at least twice to discuss concerns

about KSM's lack of cooperation.^"^^ As an ALEC Station cable noted at the time, "KSM's
pattern of behavior over the past three months, trying to control his environment, lying and then
admitting things only when pressed that others have been caught and have likely admitted the

plot, is a cause for concem."^'^^ In an email, one CIA officer noted that "what KSM's doing is
fairly typical of other detainees... KSM, Khallad [bin Attash], and others are doing what makes
sense in their situation - pretend cooperation."'''^^
In the fall of 2003, after KSM's explanations about how to decrypt

phone numbers related to British operative Issa al-Britani (KSM did not identify the operative as
"Issa al-Hindi," or by his true name, Dhiren Barot) yielded no results, and after KSM
misidentified another individual, known not to be Issa, as Issa, Deputy Chief of ALEC Station
stated in an email that KSM was "obstructing our ability to acquire good

information," noting that KSM "misidentifie[s] photos when he knows we are fishing" and
"misleads us on telephone numbers.Later, after KSM's transfer to DETENTION SITE
BLACK, ALEC Station wrote that KSM "may never be fully forthcoming and honest" on the

topic of UBL's whereabouts.^^^ Despite repeated challenges, KSM maintained thathe lacked
information on UBL's location.^^-

reports from the interrogations of KSM over a period of 3.5 years. While KSM provided more
intelligence reporting than any other CIA detainee (nearly 15 percent of all CIA detainee
intelligence reporting), CIA records indicate that KSM also received the most intelligence
requirements and attention from CIA interrogators, debriefers, analysts, and senior CIA

from KSM that the CIA identified as important threat reporting was later identified as
fabricated.^^^

H. The Growth of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program

I. Fifty-Three CIA Detainees Enter the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program in 2003
While the CIA held detainees from 2002 to 2008, early 2003 was
the most active period of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. Of the 119 detainees
identified by the Committee as held by the CIA, 53 were brought into custody in 2003, and of the
39 detainees the Committee has found to have been subjected to the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques, 17 were subjected to such techniques between January 2003 and
August 2003. The CIA's enhanced interrogations during that time were primarily used at
DETENTION SITE COBALT and DETENTION SITEBLUE.^^^ Otherinterrogations using the

CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques took place at a CIA

in Country |, at which

at least one CIA detainee was submerged in a bathtub filled with ice water.^^^
In 2003, CIA interrogators sought and received approval to use the
CIA's enhanced intenogation techniques against at least five detainees prior to their arrival at a
CIA detention facilityIn two of those cases, CIA Headquarters approved the use of the CIA's

contact State Department officials to ensure that the State Department was aware of the CIA

detention facility and its "potential impact on our policy vis-a-vis the [Country |]
govemment."^^ The U.S. ambassador was told by the CIA Station that this was not possible,
and that no one at the State Department, including the secretary of state, was informed about the

CIA detention facility in Country |. Describing the CIA's position as "unacceptable," the
ambassador then requested a signed document from "at least the President's National Security
Advisor" describing the authorities for the program, including a statement that the CIA's
interrogation techniques met "legal and human rights standards," and an explicit order to him not

to discuss the program with the secretary of state.^^^ CIA Headquarters then sought the
intervention of Deputy Secretary of State Richaid Armitage, who called the U.S. ambassador.
Deputy Secretary Armitage told the CIA to keep him and the secretary of state informed so that
they would not be caught unaware when an ambassador raised concerns.
Nearly a year later, in May 2004, revelations about U.S. detainee
abuses at the U.S. military prison in Abu Ghraib, Iraq, prompted the same U.S. ambassador in

Country | to seek information on CIA detention standards and interrogation methods.-''^'' In the
fall of2004, when |Bi U.S. ambassador to Country | sought documents authorizing the
program, the CIA again sought the intervention of Deputy Secretary Armitage, who once again

made "strong remarks" to the CIA about how he and the secretary of state were "cut out of the
NSC [National Security Council] clearance/coordination process" with regard to the CIA
program. According to CIA records, Armitage also questioned the efficacy of the program and
the value of the intelligence derived from the program.^^^ Whileit is unclearhow the
ambassador's concerns were resolved, he later joined the chief of Station in making a

presentation to Country |'s ||H^| on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. The
presentation talking points did not describe the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, but
represented that "[w]ithout the full range of these interrogation measures, we would not have

succeeded in overcoming the resistance of [Khalid Shaykh Muhammad] and other equally
resistant HVDs." The talking points included many of the same inaccurate representations'^^
made to U.S. policymakers and others, attributing to CIA detainees critical information on the
"Karachi Plot," the "Heathrow Plot," the "Second Wave Plot," and the "Guraba Cell"; as well as

intelligence related to Issa al-Hindi, Abu Talha al-Pakistani, Hambali, Jose Padilla, Binyam
Mohammed, Sajid Badat, and Jaffar al-Tayyar. The presentation also noted that the president of
the United States had directed that he not be informed of the locations of the CIA detention

facilities to ensure he would not accidentally disclose the information.'^^

Cables revealing that the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were used at CIA

that were not designated as CIA detention sites.^^^
In the first half of 2003, the CIA interrogated four detainees with
medical complications in their lower extremities: two detainees had a broken foot, one detainee

had a sprained ankle, and one detainee had a prosthetic leg.^*^^ CIA interrogators shackled each
of these detainees in the standing position for sleep deprivation for extended periods of time until
medical personnel assessed that they could not maintain the position. The two detainees that
each had a broken foot were also subjected to walling, stress positions, and cramped
confinement, despite the note in their interrogation plans that these specific enhanced

interrogation techniques were not requested because ofthe medical condition of the detainees.^^^
CIA Headquarters did not react to the site's use of these CIA enhanced interrogation techniques
despite the lack of approval.
Over the course of the CIA program, at least 39 detainees were

subjected to one or more of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.CIA records
indicate that there were at least 17 CIA detainees who were subjected to one or more CIA
enhanced interrogation techniques without CIA Headquarters approval. This count includes
detainees who were approved for the use of some techniques, but were subjected to unapproved

techniques, as well as detainees for whom interrogators had no approvals to use any of the
techniques. This count also takes into account distinctions between techniques categorized as
"enhanced" or "standard" by the CIA at the time they were appliedThe 17 detainees who

tlme they were administered with enhanced techniques that did." This statement in the CIA's June 2013 Response is
inaccurate. First, prior to January 2003, theCIAhad not yet designated any technique as a "standard" technique.
Because sleep deprivation was included in the August 1, 2002, OLC memorandum approving the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah, the Committee included, among the 17, CIA detainees
subjectedto sleep deprivation without CIA Headquarters authorization prior to January 2003. In January2003,
sleep deprivation under a specific time limit was categorized as a "standard" CIA interrogation technique. Second,
the January 2003 guidelines state thatadvance CIAHeadquarters approval was required for "standard" techniques
"whenever feasible." For this reason, tlie Committee did not include cases where CIA interrogators failed to obtain
authorization in advance, but did acquireapproval within several days of initiating the use of the "standard"

techniques. Finallywater dousing was not characterized as a "standard" technique until June 2003. {See

interrogation techniques were detailed in CIA cables, but CIA Headquarters did not respond or
take action against the CIA personnel applying the unauthorized interrogation techniques.
This list does not include examples in which CIA inten-ogators
were authorized to use the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, but then implemented the
techniques in a manner that diverged from the authorization. Examples include Abu Zubair^Â®^
and, as detailed, KSM, whose intenogators developed methods of applying the waterboard in a
manner that differed from how the technique had previously been used and how it had been
described to the Department of Justice. This count also excludes additional allegations of the
unauthorized use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.^^Â®
Over the course of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program,
numerous detainees were subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques by untrained
interrogators. As noted, the CIA did not conduct its first training course until November 2002,
by which time at least nine detainees had already been subjected to the techniques.^The DCI's
January 28, 2003, guidelines, which stated that the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques
The CIA's June 2013 Response states that the CIA "conducted at least 29 investigationsof RDI-related conduct,
plus two wide-ranging reviews of the program... one involved the death of an Afghan national who was beatenby a
contractor. The individual involved was prosecuted by the Department of Justice and convicted of a felony charge.
Another case involved a contractor whoslapped, kicked, and struckdetainees while they werein military custody.
... [T]hecontractor was terminated from the CIA,had his securityclearances revoked, and was placedon a
contractor watch list." However, the two specific examples providedin the CIA's June 2013 Response refer to

"may be employed only by approved interrogators for use with specific detainees," raised the
additional issue of approved techniques used by unapproved interrogatorsThe January 28,
2003, DCI guidelines did not explicitly require CIA Headquarters to approve who could use the
CIA's "standard" interrogation techniques, including techniques that were not previously
considered "standard" and that would later be reclassified as "enhanced" interrogation

techniques. Rather, the DCI guidelines required only that "all personnel directly engaged in the
interrogation" be "appropriately screened," that they review the guidelines, and that they receive

"appropriate training" in the implementation of the guidelines.^
4. CIA Headquarters Authorizes Water Dousing Without Department ofJustice Approval;
Application of Technique Reported as Approximating Waterboarding
CIA Headquarters approved requests to use water dousing, nudity,
the abdominal slap, and dietary manipulation, despite the fact that the techniques had not been

reviewed by the Department of Justice.^^'^ Interrogators used the water dousing technique in
various ways. At DETENTION SITE COBALT, detainees were often held down, naked, on a
tarp on the floor, with the tarp pulled up around them to form a makeshift tub, while cold or

refrigerated water was poured on them.^^^ Others were hosed down repeatedly while they were
shackled naked, in the standing sleep deprivation position. These same detainees were

subsequently placed inrooms with temperatures ranging from 59 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.^^^

Other accounts suggest detainees were water doused while placed on a waterboard.^'^ Although
CIA Headquarters approved the use of the "waterdousing" interrogation technique on several
detainees, interrogators used it extensively on a number of detainees without seeking or
obtaining prior authorization from CIA Headquarters.^^^

(TS/^H(^^^^U^^}F^runtenjoeation sessions on April 5, 2003, and April 6, 2003,
seniorCIA interrogator

another interrogator used the waterdousing

technique on detainee Mustafa al-Hawsawi at DETENTION SITE COBALT. Al-Hawsawi later

described the session to a different CIA interrogator,
who wrote that alHawsawi might have been waterboarded or subjected to treatment that "could be

indistinguishable from the waterboard."^^^ Anemail from the interrogator stated that:
"We did not prompt al-Hawsawi - he described the process and the table on
his own. As you know, I have serious reservations about watering them in a
prone position because if not done with care, the net effect can approach the
effect of the water board. If one is held down on his back, on the table or on

the floor, with water poured in his face I think it goes beyond dousing and the
effect, to the recipient, could be indistinguishable from the water board.

I have real problems with putting one of them on the water board for 'dousing.'
Putting him in a head down attiaide and pouring water around his chest and
face is just too close to the water board, and if it is continued may lead to
problems for us."^-^
Several months later, the incident was referred to the CIA inspector
general for investigation. A December 6, 2006, inspector general report summarized the findings
of this investigation, indicating that waterwas poured on al-Hawsawi while he was lying on the
floor in a prone position, which, in the opinion of at least one CIA interrogatorquoted in the

report, "can easily approximate waterboarding."^-^ The OIG could not corroborate whether alHawsawi was strapped to the waterboard when he was interrogated at DETENTION SITE
COBALT. Bodi of the interrogators who subjected al-Hawsawi to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques on April 6, 2003, said that al-Hawsawi cried out for God while the

water was being poured on him and one of the interrogators asserted that this was because of the
cold temperature of the water. Both of the interrogators also stated that al-Hawsawi saw the
waterboard and that its purpose was made clear to hira. The inspector general report also
indicates that al-Hawsawi's experience reflected "the way water dousing was done at
[DETENTION SITE COBALT]," and that this method was developed with guidance from CIA

CTC attorneys and the CIA's Office of Medical Services.^^^
Inuring the same time that al-Hawsawi claimed he was placed on
the waterboard in April 2003, a CIA linguist claimed that CIA detainee Abu Hazim had also

been water doused in away that approximated wate^arding.^^^

2003, told the OIG that;

alinguist in

"when water dousing was used on Abu Hazim, a cloth covered Abu Hazim's

[CIA OFFICER 1]] poured cold water directly on Abu

Hazim's face to disrupt his breathing. [Th^ingui^said that when Abu

Hazim turned blue, Physician's Assistant [^H^^|] removed the cloth so
that Abu Hazim could breathe."^^'^

allegation was reported to the CIA inspector general on

August 18, 2004. The CIA reported this incident as a possible criminal violation on September

CIA OIG Disposition Memorandum, "Alleged Use of Unauthorized Interrogation Techniques" OIG Case 20047604-lG, December 6, 2006.

An accusation related to an additional detainee was included in a September 6, 2012, Human Rights Watch report
entitled, "Delivered Into Enemy Hands." The report asserts that documents and interviews of former detainees
contradict CIA claims that "only three men in US custody had been waterboarded." Specifically, the report states
that Mohammed Shoroeiya, aka Abd al-Karim, "provided detailed and credible testimony that he was waterboarded
on repeated occasions duringUS intenogations in Afghanistan." According to the report, Mohammed Shoroeiya
stated that a hood was placed over his head and he was strapped to a "wooden board." Tlie former CIA detainee
stated that after being strapped to the waterboard, "then they start with the water pouring... They start to pour water

to the point where you feel like you are suffocating." As detailed in the full Committe^h^, Mohammed
Shoroeiya, aka Abd al-Karim, was rendered to CIA custody at DETENTION SITE

on April

2003.

5. Hambali Fabricates Information While Being Subjected to the CIA's Enhanced
Interrogation Techniques
In the summer of 2003, the CIA captured three Southeast Asian

operatives: Zubair,^-^ Lillie,^^^ and Hambali. (These captures are discussed later in this

summary in the section entitled, "The Capture of Hambii.")^^^
August 2003, Hambali was captured and transferred to CIA
custodyDespite assessments that Hambali was cooperative in the interview process without
"the use of more intrusive standard interrogation procedures much less the enhanced measures,"

CIA interrogators requested and obtained approval to use the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques on Hambali approximately a month after his transfer to CIA custodyIn late 2003,
Hambali recanted most of the significant information he had provided to interrogators during the
use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, recantations CIA officers assessed to be

credible.^^^ According to a CIA cable:

acquired shortly thereafter. As noted, tlieJanuary 2003 guidelines requiredadvance approval of such techniques

The cable also noted that CIA contractor Hammond DUNBAR had arrived at the detention site and was

participating in Hambali's interrogations as an interrogator. The "psychological assessment"portion of the cable
was attributed to a CIA staff psychologist, however, and not to DUNBAR.

CIA officers interrogating Hambali in November 2003 wrote about Hambali's "accountof how, through
statements read to liim and constant repetition of questions, he was made aware of what type of answers his
questioners wanted. [Hambali] said he merely gave answers that were similar to what was being asked and what he
infened the interrogator or debriefer wanted, and when the pressure subsided or he was told that the information he
gave was okay, [Hambali] knew that he had provided the answer that was being sought." The cable states, "Base

"he had provided the false information in an attempt to reduce the pressure on
himself ... and to give an account that was consistent with what [Hambali]

assessed thequestioners wanted to hear."^^^
officers later suggested that the misleading answers and
resistance to interrogation that CIA interrogators cited in their requests to use the CIA*s
enhanced interrogation techniques against Hambali and an associated CIA detainee, LilHe, may
not have been resistance to interrogation, but rather the result of issues related to culture and
their poor English language skills.

6. After the Use of the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, CIA Headquarters
Questions Detention ofDetainee and Recommends Release; Detainee Transferred to U.S.
Military Custody and Heldfor An Additional Four Years
In October 2003, the CIA interrogated Arsala Khan, an Afghan
national in his mid-fifties who was believed to have assisted Usama bin Laden in his escape

through the Tora Bora Mountains in late 2001.^^^ After 56 hours of standing sleep deprivation,
Arsala Khan was described as barely able to enunciate, and being "visibly shaken by his
hallucinations depicting dogs mauling and killing his sons and family." According to CIA
cables, Arsala Khan "stated that [the interrogator] was responsible for killing them and feeding

them to the dogs."^^^

Arsala Khan was subsequently allowed to sleep.^^^ Two days later,
however, the interrogators returned him to standing sleep deprivation. After subjecting Khan to
21 additional hours of sleep deprivation, interrogators stopped using the CIA's enhanced
weeks of daily debriefing sessions with [tlie case officer] carried out almost entirely in Bahasa Indonesia. [Hambali]
has consistently waimed to [tlie case officer's] discussions with him, and has provided to [the case officer]
additional information that he had avoided in tlie past... More tellingly, [Hambali] has opened up considerably to
[the case officer] about his fears and motivations, and has taken to trusting [the case officer] at his word. [Hambali]

looks to [the case officer] ashis sole confidant and the one person who has [Hambali]'s interest in mind^^J^5e^^

interrogation techniques "[d]ue to lack of information from [Arsala Klian] pinning him directly
to a recent activity.Three days after the reporting about Khan's hallucinations, and after the
interrogators had already subjected Khan to the additional 21 hours of standing sleep deprivation
(beyond the initial 56 hours), CIA Headquarters sent a cable stating that RDG and the Office of

Medical Services believed that Arsala Khan should not be subjected to additional standing sleep
deprivation beyond the 56 hours because of his hallucinations.^^'^
After approximately a month of detention and the extensive use of
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on Arsala Khan, tlie CIA concluded that the
"detainee Arsala Khan docs not appear to be the subject involved in... current plans or activities

against U.S. personnel or facilities," and recommended that he be released to his village with a
cash payment.^Â® CIA interrogators at DETENTION SITE COBALT instead transferred him to
U.S. military custody, where he was held for an additional four years despite the development of
significant intelligence indicating that the source who reported that Arsala Khan had aided
Usama bin Laden had a vendetta against Arsala Khan's family.^^
7. A Year After DETENTION SITE COBALT Opens, the CIA Reports "Unsettling Discovery
That We Are Holding a Number of Detainees About Whom We Know Very Little"
In the fall of 2003, CIA officers began to take a closer look at the

CIA detainees being held in Country

raising concerns about both the number and types of

detainees being held by the CIA. CIA officers in Country | provided a list ofCIA detainees to
CIA Headquarters, resulting in the observation by CIA Headquarters that they had not previously
had the names of all 44 CIA detainees being held in that country. At the direction of CIA

Headquarters, the Station in Country | "completed an exhaustive search ofall available records
in an attempt to develop a clearer understanding of the [CIA] detainees." A December 2003

cable from the Station in Country | to CIA Headquarters stated that;
"In the process of this research, we have made the unsettling discovery that we
are holding a number of detainees about whom we know very little. The

majority of [CIA] detainees in [Country | | have not been debriefed for months
and, in some cases, for over a year. Many of them appear to us to have no
further intelligence value for [the CIAl and should more properly be turned

over to the [U.S. military], to [Country |] authorities or to third countries for
further investigation and possibly prosecution. In a few cases, there does not
appear to be enough evidence to continue incarceration, and, if this is in fact
the case, the detainees should be released."^^

Records indicate that all of these CIA detainees had been kept in

receiving CIA payments for having been held in detention.

8. CIA Detention Sites in Country | Lack Sufficient Personnel and Translators to Support
the Interrogations of Detainees

Throughout 2003, the CIA lacked sufficient personnel and
adequate translators to conduct debriefings and interrogations in Counti7
Because of this
personnel shortage, a number of detainees who were transferred to CIA custody were not
inten-ogated or debriefed by anyone for days or weeks after their arrival at CIA detention

facilities in Country

As noted ina cable from the CIA Station in Country |, in April 2003:

"Station is supporting the debriefing and/or interrogation of a lai'ge number of
individuals... and is constrained by a lack of personnel which would allow us

to fully process them in a timely manner."^^

1. CIA Interrogations Take Precedence Over Medical Care
While CIA Headquarters informed the Department of Justice in
July 2002 "that steps will be taken to ensure that [Abu Zubaydah's] injury is not in any way

exacerbated by the use of these [enhanced inteiTogation] methods,"^"^^ CIA Headquarters
informed CIA interrogators that the interrogation process would take "precedence" over Abu

Zubaydah's medical care.^"^^ Beginning on August 4, 2002, Abu Zubaydah was kept naked, fed a
"bare bones" liquid diet, and subjected to the non-stop use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation

techniques.^'^Â® On August 15, 2002, medical personnel described how Abu Zubaydah's

interrogation resulted in the "steady deterioration" of his surgical wound from April 2002.^'^^ On

physically due to [their] ability to sleep in the sitting position."^^^ On May 12, 2003, a different
CIA physician assistant, who had not been involved in the previous examinations determining
the need for the detainees to avoid weight bearing, stated that it was his "opinion" that Abu
Hazim's and Abd al-Karim's injuries were "sufficiently healed to allow being placed in the

standing sleep deprivation position."^^^ He further reported that he had "consulted with [CIA's
Office of Medical Services] via secure phone and OMS medical officer concurred in this

assessment."^^^ CIA Headquarters approved the use of standing sleep deprivation against both
detainees shortly thereafter.As a result, both detainees were placed in standing sleep
deprivation. Abu Hazim underwent 52 hours of standing sleep deprivation from June 3-5,
2003,^^^ and Abd al-Karim underwent an unspecified period of standing sleep deprivation on

May 15, 2003.^^^

While CIA records contain information on other detainee medical complaints (see Volume III), those records also

suggest that detainee medicalcomplaints could be underreported in CIA medical records. For example, CIA
medical records consistently report that CIA detainee Ramzi bin al-Shibh had no medical complaints. However,
CIA interrogation records indicate that when bin al-Shibhhad previously complained of ailments to CIA personnel,

he was subjected to the CIA's enhanced intenogationtechniques and told by CIA inte^ogators that liis medical

condition was not ofconcern to the CIA. (5ee |H|HH 10591 (252002Z FEB 03); m[||p|||10627 (281949Z
FEB 03).) In testimony on April 12, 2007, CIA Director Michael Hayden referenced medical care of detainees in
the context of the ICRC report on CIA detentions. Hayden testified to the Committee; "The medical section of the
ICRC report concludes that the association of CIA medical officers witlithe intenogation program is 'contrary to
international standaids of medical ethics.' That is just wrong. Tlie role of CIA medical officers in tlie detainee

program is and always has been and always will be to ensure thesafety and the well-being of the detainee. The
placement of medical officers during the interrogation techniques represents an extra measure of caution. Our
medical officers do not recommend the employment or continuation of any procedures or techniques. The allegation
in the report that a CIA medical officer threatened a detainee, stating that medical care was conditional on
cooperation is blatantly false. Healthcare has always been administered basedupon detainee needs. It's neither
policy nor practice to link medical care to any other aspect of the detainee program." This testimony was
incongruent with CIA records.

management challenges for the
For example, later in his detention, Ramzi bin al-Shibh
exhibited behavioral and psychological problems, including visions, paranoia, insomnia, and

attempts at self-harm.^^^ CIA psychologists linked bin al-Shibh's deteriorating mental state to
his isolation and inability to cope with his long-term detention.^^^ Similarly, 'Abd al-Rahim alNashiri's unpredictable and disruptive behavior in detention made him one of the most difficult

detainees for the CIA to manage. Al-Nashiri engaged in repeated belligerent acts, including

throwing his food tray,^^^ attempting to assault detention site personnel,and trying to damage
items inhis cell.^^^ Over a period ofyears, al-Nashiri accused the CIA staff ofdrugging or
poisoning his food and complained of bodily painand insomnia.^^^ As noted, at one point, alNashiri launched a short-lived hunger strike, and the CIA responded by force feeding him

rectally.^^^ An October 2004 psychological assessment ofal-Nashiri was used by the CIA to
advance its discussions with National Security Council officials on establishing an "endgame"

for the program.^^'^ In July 2005, CIA Headquarters expressed concern regarding al-Nashiri's
"continued state of depression and uncooperative attitude."^"^^ Days later a CIA psychologist
assessed that al-Nashiri was on the "verge of a breakdown."^^^
Beginning in March 2004, and continuing until his rendition to

U.S. military custody at Guantanamo Bay in September 2006, Majid Khan engaged in a series of
hunger strikes and attempts at self-mutilation that required significant attention from CIA
detention site personnel. In response to Majid Khan's hunger strikes, medical personnel

J. The CIA Seeks Reaffirmation of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program in 2003
1. Administration Statements About the Humane Treatment of Detainees Raise Concerns at
the CIA About Possible Lack of Policy Supportfor CIA Interrogation Activities

On several occasions in early 2003, CIA General Counsel Scott
Muller expressed concern to the National Security Council principals, White House staff, and
Department of Justice personnel that the CIA's program might be inconsistent with public
statements from the Administration that the U.S. Government's treatment of detainees was

"humane."^^^ CIA General Counsel Muller therefore sought to verify with White House and
Department of Justice personnel that a February 7, 2002, Presidential Memorandum requiring the

U.S. military to treat detainees humanely did not apply to the CIA.^^^ Following those

rehydration" is a "well acknowledged medical technique to address pressing health issues." A follow-up CIA
document provided on October 25,2013 (DTS #2013-3152), states that "[fjrom a health perspective, Majid Klian
became uncooperative on 31 August 2004, when he initiated a hunger strike and before he underwent rectal
rehydration... CIA assesses that the use of rectal rehydration is a medically sound hydration technique...." Tlie
assertion that Majid Khan was "uncooperative" prior to rectal rehydration and rectal feeding is inaccurate. As
described in CIA records, prior to being subjected to rectal rehydration and rectal feeding, Majid Khan cooperated
with the nasogastric feedings and was pennitted to infuse the fluids and nutrients himself.

discussions in early 2003, the White House press secretary was advised to avoid using the term
"humane treatment" when discussing the detention of al-Qa'ida and Taliban personnel.^^^
In mid-2003, CIA officials also engaged in discussions with the
Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and attorneys in the White House on whether
representations could be made that the U.S. Government complied with certain requirements
arising out of the Convention Against Torture, namely that the treatment of detainees was
consistent with constitutional standards in the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.In
late June 2003, after numerous inter-agency discussions, William Haynes, the general counsel of
the Department of Defense, responded to a letter from Senator Patrick Leahy stating that it was

H^BcTC Legal,
August 1, 2002, OLC opinion provided alegal

"safe harbor" for the CIA's use of its enhanced interrogation techniques.The August 1, 2002,
opinion did not, however, address the constitutional standards described in the letter from
William Haynes.
In July 2003, after the White House made a number of statements
again suggesting that U.S. treatment of detainees was "humane," the CIA asked the national

security advisor for policy reaffirmation of the CIA's use of its enhanced interrogation
techniques. During the time that request was being considered, CIA Headquarters stopped
approving requests from CIA officers to use the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.^^'
Because of this stand-down, CIA interrogators, with CIA Headquarters approval, instead used
repeated applications of the CIA's "standard" interrogation techniques. These "standard"
techniques were coercive, but not considered to be as coercive as the CIA's "enhanced"

interrogation techniques. At this time, sleep deprivation beyond 72 hours was considered an

"enhanced" interrogation technique, while sleep deprivation under 72 hours was defined as a
"standard" CIA interrogation technique. To avoid using an "enhanced" interrogation technique,
CIA officers subjected Khallad bin Attash to 70 hours of standing sleep deprivation, two hours
less than the maximum. After allowing him four hours of sleep, bin Attash was subjected to an
additional 23 hours of standing sleep deprivation, followed immediately by 20 hours of seated

sleep deprivation.^^^
Unlike during most of the CIA's interrogation program, during the
time that CIA Headquarters was seeking policy reaffirmation, the CIA responded to infractions
in the interrogation program as reported through CIA cables and other communications.

reaffirmation of its coercive interrogation program. The presentation included a list of the CIA's
standard and enhanced interrogation techniques. CIA General Counsel Muller also provided a
description of the waterboard inten'ogation technique, including the inaccurate representation

that it had beenused against KSM 119 times and Abu Zubaydah 42 times.^^^ The presentation
warned National Security Councilprincipals in attendance that "termination of this program will
result in loss of life, possibly extensive." The CIA officers further noted that 50 percent of CIA
intelligence reports on al-Qaida were derived from detainee reporting, and that "major threats
were countered and attacks averted" because of the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques. The CIA provided specific examples of "attacks averted" as a result of using the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, including references to the U.S. Consulate in Karachi,
the Heathrow Plot, the Second Wave Plot, and lyman Faris,^^^ As described later in this
summary, and in greater detail in Volume 11, these claims were inaccurate. After the CIA's

presentation, Vice President Cheney stated, and National Security Advisor Rice agreed, that the

CIA was executing Administration policy in carrying out its interrogation program.^Â®Â®
The National Security Council principals at the July 2003 briefing
initially concluded it was "not necessary or advisable to have a full Principals Committee

meeting to review and reaffirm the Program."''Â®^ A CIA email noted that the officialreason for
not having a full briefing was to avoid press disclosures, but added that:

"it is clear to us from some of the runup meetings we had with [White House]
Counsel that the [White House] is extremely concerned [Secretary of State]

CIA records indicate that KSM received at least 183 applications of the waterboard technique, and that Abu
Zubaydali received at least 83 applications of the waterboard technique. In April 2003,CIA InspectorGeneral John
Helgerson asked General Counsel Scott Muller aboutthe repetitious use of the waterboard. In early June 2003,
White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and the Vice President's Counsel, David Addington, who were aware of the
inspectorgeneral's concerns,asked Mullerwhether the numberof waterboard repetitions had been too high in light
of tlie OLC guidance. This question prompted Muller to seek information on the use of the waterboard on Abu
Zubaydah and KSM. (See interview of Scott Muller, by [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and
[REDACTED], Office of the Inspector General, August 20, 2003; and email from: Scott Muller; to: John Rizzo; cc:

[REDACTED], â¢â¢â¢â¢1,
[REDACTED]; subject: "Report from
Gitmo trip (Not proofread, as usual)"; date: June |, 2003, 05:47 PM.) As Muller told the OIG, he could not keep up
with cable traffic from CIA detainee interrogations and instead received monthly briefings. According to OIG
records of the interview, Muller "saidhe does notknow specifically how [CIA guidelines on intenogations] changed
because he does not get that far down into the weeds," and "each detainee is different and those in the field have

somelatitude." (See interview of ScottMuller, Office of the Inspector General, August 20, 2003.) Despitethis
record and others detailed in the full CommitteeStudy, the CIA's June 2013 Response asserts that the CIA's
"confinementconditions and treatment of high profiledetainees like Abu Zubaydah were closely scrutinizedat all
levels of management from the outset."

National Security Advisor Rice, however, subsequently decided
that Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld should be

briefed on the CIA interrogation program prior to recertification of the covert action^^^ As
described, both were then formally briefed on the CIA program for the first time in a 25 minute
briefing on September 16, 2003

On September 4, 2003, CIA records indicate that CIA officials may
have provided Chairman Roberts, Vice Chairman Rockefeller, and their staff directors a briefing

K. Additional Oversight and Outside Pressure in 2004: ICRC, Inspector General, Congress,
and the U.S. Supreme Court

1. ICRC Pressure Leads to Detainee Transfers; Department ofDefense Official Informs the
CIA that the U.S. Government "Should Not Be in the Position of Causing People to
Disappear"; the CIA Provides Inaccurate Information on CIA Detainee to the
Department ofDefense

f^NÂ¥) In January 2004, the ICRC sent a letter to |
indicating that it was aware that the United States Government was holding

unacknowledged detainees inseveral facilities in Country | "incommunicado for extensive
periods of time, subjected to unacceptable conditions of internment, to ill treatment and torture,

while deprived of any possible recourse."^''^ According to the CIA, the letter included a "fairly
complete list" of CIA detainees to whom the ICRC had not had access.^^^ This prompted CIA
Headquarters to conclude that it was necessary to reduce the number of detainees in CIA

custody

The CIA subsequently transferred at least 25 of its detainees in Country | to the

U.S. military and foreign governments. The CIA also released five detainees.^^^

called the CIA to inform the CIA that Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz would not

would harm U.S. national security. According to an internal CIA email following the call, the
deputy secretary of defense had listened to the CIA's arguments for nondisclosure, but believed
that it was time for full notification. The email stated that the Department of Defense supported

2. CIA Leadership Calls Draft Inspector General Special Review of the Program
"Imbalanced and Inaccurate," Responds with Inaccurate Information; CIA Seeks to
Limit Further Review of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program by the Inspector
General

The CIA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) was first
informed of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program in November 2002, nine months
after Abu Zubaydah became the CIA's first detainee. As described, the information was
conveyed by the DDO, who also informed the OIG of the death of Gul Rahman. In January
2003, the DDO further requested that the OIG investigate allegations of unauthorized
inten'ogation techniques against 'Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. Separately, the OIG "received
information that some employees were concerned that certain covert Agency activities at an
overseas detention and interrogation site might involve violations of human rights," according to

the OIG's Special Review.^^Â®
During the course of the OIG's interviews, numerous CIA officers
expressed concerns about the CIA's lack of preparedness for the detention and interrogation of

Abu Zubaydah.^^^ Other CIA officers expressed concern about the analytical assumptions
driving interrogations,^^- as well as the lack of language andcultural background among

The chief of Station in the country that hosted the CIA's first detention site told the OIG that "[t]he Reports

not native Arab speakers, and at least one ofthe [chiefs ofBase] had limited fielc^xperience/\^e Interview report

In addition to the statements to the OIG describe^bove^eg^ing the interrogation ofAbu Zubaydah, CIA
officers expressed more general concerns. As

members of the interrogation teams7^^ Some CIA officers described pressure from CIA
Headquarters to use the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, which they attributed to faulty
analytical assumptions about what detainees should know.^^"^ As the chief of RDG,

|, stated to the OIG in a February 2003 interview:
"CTC does not know a lot about al-Qa'ida and as a result, Headquarters

analyst^a^ constructed 'models' ofwhat al-Qa'ida represents to them.
noted that the Agency does not have the linguists or subject
matter experts it needs. The questions sent from CTC/Usama bin Laden

(UBL) to the interrogators are basedon SIGINT [signals intelligence] and
other intelligence that often times is incomplete or wrong. When the detainee
does not respond to the question, the assumption at Headquarters is that the
detainee is holding back and 'knows' more, and consequently. Headquarters
recommends resumption of EITs. This difference of opinion between the
interrogators and Headquarters as to whether the detainee is 'compliant' is the
type of ongoing pressure the interrogation team is exposed to.

intelligence."^-^

senior interrogator,
informed the OIG that
differences between CIA Headquarters and the interrogators at the CIA detention sites were not

part of the official record. According to

"all of the fighting and criticism is done over

the phone and is not put into cables," and that CIA "[cjables reflect things that are 'allrosy.'"^^^
As is described elsewhere, and reflected in the final OIG Special

Review, CIA officers discussed numerous other topics with the OIG, including conditions at
DETENTION SITE COBALT, specific inteiTogadons, the video taping of interrogations, the
administration of the program, and concerns about the lack of an "end game" for CIA detainees,
as well as the impact of possible public revelations concerning the existence and operadon of the

CIA's Detention and Interrogation Progi-amJ-^
In January 2004, the CIA inspector general circulated for comment
to various offices within the CIA a draft of the OIG Special Review of the CIA's Detention and

Interrogation Program. Among other matters, the OIG Special Review described divergences
between the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques as applied and as described to the
Department of Justice in 2002, the use of unauthorized techniques, and oversight problems
related to DETENTION SITE COBALT. The draft OIG Special Review elicited responses from

the CIA's deputy director for operations, the deputy director for science and technology, the
Office of General Counsel, and the Office of Medical Services. Several of the responsesâ

particularly those from CIA General Counsel Scott Muller and CIA Deputy Director for
Operations James Pavittâwere highly critical of the inspector general's draft Special Review.
General Counsel Muller wrote that the OIG Special Review presented "an imbalanced and

inaccurate picture of the Counterterrorism Detention and Interrogation Program," and claimed
the OIG Special Review, "[o]n occasion," "quoted or summarized selectively and misleadingly"
from CIA documents.^^^ Deputy Directorfor Operations James Pavitt wrote that the OIG
Special Review should have come to the "conclusion that our efforts have thwarted attacks and
saved lives," and that "EITs (including the water board) have been indispensable to our
successes." Pavitt attached to his response a document describing information the CIA obtained
"as a result of the lawful use of EITs" that stated, "[t]he evidence points clearly to the fact that

without the use of such techniques, we and our allies would [have] suffered major terrorist

DDO Pavitt described possible public revelations related to the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program as
"the CIA's worst nightmare." Interviewof James Pavitt,Officeof the InspectorGeneral, September 21, 2003.
According to OIG recordsof an interview with DCI Tenet, "Tenet believesthat if the general public were to find out
about this program, many would believe we are torturers." Tenet added, however, that his "only potential moral
di lemma would be if more Americans die at the hands of teiTorists and we had someone in our custody who

possessed information that couldhaveprevented deaths, butwe had notobtained such information." See interview
of George Tenet, Officeof the InspectorGeneral, memorandum dated, September8, 2003.

attacks involving hundreds, if not thousands, of casiialties."^-^ A review of CIA records found

that the representations in the Pavitt materials were almostentirely inaccurateJ^^
addition to conveying inaccurate information on the operation,

management, and effectiveness of the CIA program, CIA leadership continued to impede the
OIG in its efforts to oversee the program. In July 2005, Director Goss sent a memorandum to the
inspector general to "express several concerns regarding the in-depth, multi-faceted review" of
the CIA's CTC. The CIAdirector wrote that he was "increasingly concerned about the
cumulative impact of the OIG's work on CTC's performance," adding that "I believe it makes
sense to complete existingreviews... before opening new ones." DirectorGoss added, "[t]o my
knowledge, Congress is satisfied that you are meetingits requirements" with regard to the CIA's
Detention and Interrogation Program.^^^ At the time, however, the vice chairman of the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence was seeking a Committee investigation of the CIA program, in
part because of the aspects of the program that were not being investigated by the Office of

Inspector General.^^^ In April 2007, CIA Director Michael Hayden had his "Senior
Councilor"âan individual within the CIA who was accountable only to the CIA directorâ
conduct a review of the inspector general's practices. Defending the decision to review the OIG,
the CIA told the Committee that there were "morale issues that the [CIA] director needs to be

mindful of," and that the review had uncovered instances of "bias" among OIG personnel against
the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.^^^ In 2008, the CIA director announced the
results of his review of the OIG to the CIA work force and stated that the inspector general had
"chosen to take a numberof steps to heighten the efficiency, assure the quality, and increase the
transparency of the investigative process."^^"^
3. The CIA Does Not Satisfy Inspector General Special Review Recommendation to Assess
the Effectiveness of the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation Techniques
The final May 2004 OIG Special Review included a
recommendation that the CIA's DDO conduct a study of the effectiveness of the CIA's
interrogation techniques within 90 days. Prompted by the recommendation, the CIA tasked two

seniorCIA officers to lead "an informal operational assessment of the CIA detainee program."
The reviewers were tasked with responding to 12 specific terms of reference, including an
assessment of "the effectiveness of each interrogation technique and environmental deprivation"

to determine if any techniques ordeprivation should be "added, modified, ordiscontinued."^^^
According to a CIA memorandum from the reviewers, their review was based on briefings by
CTC personnel, "a discussion with three senior CTC managers who played key roles in running
tlie CIA detainee program," and a review of nine documents, including the OIG Special Review
and an article by the CIA contractors who developed the CIA's enhanced interrogation

techniques, Hammond DUNBAR and Grayson SWIGERT^^^ As described in this summary,
and in more detail in Volume H, these documents contained numerous inaccurate representations

regarding the operation andeffectiveness of the CIA program. There are no records to indicate
the two senior CIA officers reviewed the underlying interrogation cables and intelligence records
related to the representations. Their resulting assessment repeated information found in the
documents provided to them and reported that the "CIA Detainee Program is a success,
providing unique and valuable intelligence at the tactical levelfor the benefit of policymakers,
war fighters, and the CIA's covert action operators." The assessment also reported that
regulations and procedures for handling detainees were "adequate and clear," and that the
program had responded swiftly, fairly, and completely to deviations from the structured
program.^^^ Nonetheless, the assessment came to the conclusion that detention and
interrogations activities should not be conducted by the CIA, but by "experienced U.S. law
enforcement officers," stating:

"The Directorate of Operations (DO) should not be in the business of nmning
prisons or 'temporary detention facilities,' The DO should focus on its core
mission: clandestine intelligence operations. Accordingly, the DO should
continue to hunt, capture, and render targets, and then exploit them for
intelligence and ops leads once in custody. The management of their
incarceration and interrogation should be conducted by appropriately
experienced U.S. law enforcement officers, because that is tlieir charter and
they have the training and experience.
assessment noted that the CIA program required significant
resources at a time when the CIA was already stretched thin. Finally, the authors wrote that they

"strongly believe" that the president and congressional oversight members should receive a

On January 26, 2005, DCI Goss forwarded the senior officer

review to Inspector General John Helgerson/"^^ The DCI asked whether the review would satisfy
the inspector general recommendation for anindependent review of the programJ"^^ On January
28, 2005, the inspector general responded that the senior officer review would not satisfy the

recommendation fo^TMndepet^ent review.^"^^ The inspector general also responded to a

concern raised by H^|^^|OMS that studying the results of CIA interrogations would
amount to human experimentation, stating:

"I fear there was a misunderstanding. OIG did not have in mind doing
additional, guinea pig reseai'ch on human beings. What we are recommending
is that the Agency undertake a careful review of its experience to date in using
the various techniques and that it draw conclusions about their safety,
effectiveness, etc., that can guide CIA officers as we move ahead. We make
this recommendation because we have found that the Agency over the decades

has continued to get itself in messes related to interrogation programs for one
overriding reason: we do not document and learn from our experience - each
generation of officers is left to improvise anew, with problematic results for
our officers as individuals and for our Agency. We are not unaware that there
are subtleties to this matter, as the effectiveness of techniques varies among
individuals, over time, as administered, in combination with one another, and

so on. All the more reason to document these important findings."^"^^
I" November and December 2004, the CIA responded to National

Security Advisor Rice's questions about the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques by asserting that an effectiveness review was not possible, while highlighting
examples of "[k]ey intelligence" the CIA represented was obtained after the use of the CIA's

enhanced interrogation techniques. The December 2004 memorandum prepared for the national
security advisor entitled, "Effectiveness of the CIA Counterterrorist Interrogation Techniques,"

"Action Requested: None, This memorandum responds to your request for an
independent study of the foreign intelligence efficacy of using enhanced
interrogation techniques. There is no way to conduct such a study. What we
can do, however, if [sic] set forth below the intelligence the Agency obtained
from detainees who, before their interrogations, were not providing any
information of intelligence [value].

(T8/^BimHiH^^^) Under a section ofthe memorandum entitled, "Results," the CIA
memo asserts that the "CIA's use of DOJ-approved enhanced inten'ogation techniques, as part of
a comprehensive interrogation approach, has enabled CIA to disrupt terrorist plots [and] capture
additional terrorists." The memorandum then lists examples of "[k]ey intelligence collected
from HVD interrogations after applying interrogation techniques," which led to "disrupte[ed]
terrorist plots" and the "capture [of] additional terrorists." The examples include: the "Karachi
Plot," the "Heathrow Plot," "the 'Second Wave'" plotting, the identification of the "the Guraba
Cell," the identification of "Issa al-Hindi," the airest of Abu Talha al-Pakistani, "Hambali's
Capture," information on Jaffar al-Tayyar, the "Dirty Bomb" plot, the arrest of Sajid Badat, and
information on Shkai, Pakistan. CIA records do not indicate when, or if, this memorandum was

provided to the national security advisor.^'^^
a subsequent CIA memorandum, dated March 5, 2005, concerning
an upcoming meeting between the CIA director and the national security advisor on the CIA's
progress in completing the OIG recommended review of the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques states, "we [CIA] believe this study is much needed and should be
headed up by highly respected national-level poHtical figures with widely recognized reputations

for independence andfairness."^"^^

second panelist] concluded that "there is no
objective way to answer the question of efficacy," but stated it was possible to "make some
general observations" about the program based on CIA personnel assessments of "the quality of
the intelligence provided" by CIA detainees. Regarding the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques, he wrote: "here enters the epistemological problem. We can never
know whether or not this intelligence could have been extracted though alternative procedures.
Spokesmen from within the organization firmly believe it could not have been."^"^^

4. The CIA Wrongfully DetainsKhalidAl-Masri; CIA Director Rejects Accountabilityfor
Officer Involved

After the dissemination of the draft CIA Inspector General Special

Review in early 2004, approvals from CIA Headquarters to use the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques adhered more closely to the language of the DCI guidelines. Nonetheless, CIA
records indicate that officers at CIA Headquarters continued to fail to properly monitor
justifications for the capture and detention of detainees, as well as the justification for the use of
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on particular detainees.^^Â®

Por example, on January H, 2004, the CIA rendered German
citizen Khalid al-Masri to a Country | facility used by the CIA for detention purposes. The
rendition was based on the determination by officers in the CIA's ALEC Station that "al-Masri

knows key information that could assist in the capture of otheral-Qa'ida operatives that pose a
serious threat of violence or death to U.S. persons and interests and who may be planning
terrorist activities.The cable did not state that Khalid al-Masri himself posed a serious threat
of violence or death, the standard required for detention under the September 17, 2001,
Memorandum of Notification (MON).

CIA debriefing cables from Country | on January 27, 2004, and
January 28, 2004, note that Khalid al-Masri "seemed bewildered on why he has been sent to this

particular prison,"^^^ and was "adamant that [CIA] has the wrong person."^^^ Despite doubts
from CIA officers in Country | about Khalid al-Masri's links to terrorists, and RDG's
concurrence with those doubts, differentcomponents within the CIA disagreed on the process for

his release.^^"^ As later described by the CIA inspector general, officers in ALEC Station
continued to think that releasing Khalid al-Masri would pose a threat to U.S. interests and that

Investigation on the rendition and detention of Khalid al-Masri, concluding that "[a]vailable
intelligence information did not provide a sufficient basis to render and detain Khalid al-Masri,"

the CIA informed the Committee that it "lacked sufficient basis to render and detain al-Masri,"

posed a threat to U.S. interests "was not supported by available intelligence/^^^eCIA director
nonetheless decided that no further action was warranted against

strongly believes that mistakes should be expected in a business filled with uncertainty and that,

As the dissemination of 21 intelligence reports suggests, information in CIA records indicates Hassan Ghul was

cooperative prior to being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. In an interview with the CIA
Office of InspectorGeneral, a CIA officerfamiliar with Ghul's initial interrogations stated,"He sang like a tweetie
bird. He opened up right away and was cooperative from the outset." {See December 2, 2004, interview with
[REDACTED], Chief, DO, CTC UBL Department,
) CIA records reveal that Ghul's

information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti wasdisseminated while Ghul was at DETENTION SITECOBALT, prior to
the initiation of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. On April 16, 2013, tlie Council on Foreign Relations
hosted a forum in relation to the screening of the film, "Manhunt." Tlie forum included former CIA officer Nada
Bakos, who states in the film that Hassan Ghul provided the critical information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti to

Kurdish officialsprior to entering CIA custody. When asked about the interrogation techniques used by the Kurds,

Peshawar area," and that "it was well known that he was always with Abu Ahmed [al-

Kuwaiti]."^^^ Ghul described Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti as UBL's "closest assistant,who
couriered messages to al-Qa'ida's chief of operations, and listed al-Kuwaiti as one of three
individuals likely with
Ghul further speculated that:
"UBL's security apparatus would be minimal, and that the group likely
lived in a house with a family somewhere in Pakistan.... Ghul speculated
that Abu Ahmed likely handled all of UBL's needs, including moving

messages out to Abu Faraj [al-Libi]...."^^^
During this same period, prior to the use of the CL\'s enhanced
interrogation techniques, Ghul provided information related to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Abu
Faraj al-Libi (including his role in delivering messages from UBL), Jaffar al-Tayyar, 'Abd alHadi al-Iraqi, Hamza Rabi'a, Shaik Sa'id al-Masri, Sharif al-Masri, Abu 'Abd al-Rahman alNajdi, Abu Talha al-Pakistani, and numerous other al-Qa'ida operatives. He also provided
information on the locations, movements, operational security, and training of al-Qa'ida leaders

living in Shkai, Pakistan, as well as on the visits of other leaders and operatives to Shkai.^^^
Ghul's reporting on Shkai, which was included in at least 16 of the 21 intelligence reports,
confirmed earlier reporting that the Shkai valley sei-ved as al-Qa'ida's command and control

center afterthe group's 2001 exodus from Afghanistan.^^"^ Notwithstanding these facts, in March

Bakos stated:
..honestly, Hassan Ghul.. .when he was being debriefed by the Kurdish government, he literally
was sitting there having tea. He was in a safe house. He wasn't locked up in a cell. He wasn't handcuffed to
anything. He wasâhe was having a free flowing conversation. And there'sâyou know, there's articles in Kurdish
papers about sort of their interpretation of tlie story and how forthcoming he was." (See
www.cfr.org/counterterrorism/film-screening-manhunt/p30560.) Given the unusually high number of intelligence
reports disseminated in such a short time period, and the statements of former CIA officer Bakos, the Committee
requested additional information from the CIA on Ghul's interrogation prior to entering CIA custody. The CIA
wrote on October 25, 2013: "We have not identified any information in our holdings suggesting that Hassan Gul
first provided information on Abu Ahmad while in [foreign] custody." No information was provided on Hassan
Ghul's intelligence reporting while in U.S. military detention. See DTS #2013-3152.

2005, the CIA represented to the Department of Justice that Hassan Ghul's reporting on Shkai
was acquired ''after''' the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniquesJ^^
After two days of questioning at DETENTION SITE COBALT
and the dissemination of 21 intelligence reports, Ghul was transferred to DETENTION SITE

BLACKJ^^ According to CIA records, upon arrival, Ghul was "shaved and barbered, stripped,
and placed in the standing position against the wall" with "his hands above his head" with plans

to lower his hands after two hours^^'' The CIA interrogators at the detention site then requested
to use the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on Ghul, writing:
"[the] interrogation team believes, based on [Hassan Ghul's] reaction to the

initial contact, that his ai-Qa'ida briefings and his earlier experiences with U.S.
military interrogators have convinced him there are limits to the physical
contact interrogators can have with him. The interrogation team believes the
approval and employment of enhanced measures should sufficiently shift
[Hassan Ghul's] paradigm of what he expects to happen. The lack of these
increasd [sic] measures may limit the team's capability to collect critical and
reliable information in a timely manner."^^^

(^FS/4|^H|||||||^^H||//NE) CIA Headquarters approved the request the same day.^^^
Following 59 hours of sleep deprivation,^^*^ Hassan Ghulexperienced hallucinations, but was told
by a psychologist that his reactions were "consistent with what many others experience in his
condition," and that he should calm himself by telling himself his experiences are normal and

will subside when he decides to be truthfiil.^^^ The sleep deprivation, as well as otherenhanced

interrogations, continued,^^- as did Ghul's hallucinations.''^^ Ghul also complained of back pain
and asked to see a doctor,^^"^ but interrogators responded that the "pain was normal, and would
stop when [Ghul] was confirmed as telling the tnith." A cable states that "[i]nterrogators told
[Ghul] they did not care if he was in pain, but cared only if he provided complete and truthful
information.A CIA physician assistant later observed that Hassan Ghul was experiencing
"notable physiological fatigue," including "abdominal and back muscle pain/spasm, 'heaviness'
and mild paralysis of arms, legs and feet [that] are secondary to his hanging position and extreme

Throughout this period, Ghul provided no actionable threat information, and as detailed later in
this summary, much of his reporting on the al-Qa'ida presence in Shkai was repetitive of his
reporting prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. Ghul also provided no
other information of substance on UBL facilitator Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti7^^ Nonetheless, on
May 5, 2011, the CIA provided a document to the Committee entitled, "Detainee Reporting on
Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti," which lists Hassan Ghul as a CIA detainee who was subjected to the

CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and whopmvided^TierOne|Mnfo

In March 2004, the CIA took custody of an Afghan national who

had sought employment at a U.S. military base because he had the same name (Gul Rahman) as

an individual believed to be targeting U.S. military forces in Afghanistan.^^^ During the period
in which the Afghan was detained, the CIA obtained signals intelligence of their true target
communicating with his associates. DNA results later showed conclusively that the Afghan in
custody was not the target. Nonetheless, the CIA held the detainee in solitary confinement for

approximately a month before he was released with a nominal payment.^^^
In the spring of 2004, after two detainees were transferred to CIA
custody, CIA interrogators proposed, and CIA Headquarters approved, using the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques on one of the two detainees because it might cause the detainee to
provide information that could identify inconsistencies in the other detainee's storyAfter
both detainees had spent approximately 24 hours shackled in the standing sleep deprivation

position, CIA Headquarters confirmed that the detainees were former CIA sources.^^"^ The two
detainees had tried to contact the CIA on multiple occasions prior to their detention to inform the
CIA of their activities and provide intelligence. The messages they had sent to the CIA

enhanced interrogation techniques

During this same period in early 2004, CIA inten^ogators

interrogated Adnan al-Libi, a member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. CIA Headquarters
did not approve the use of the CIA's enhanced techniques against al-Libi, but indicated that
interrogators could use "standard" interrogation techniques, which included up to 48 hours of

sleep deprivationJ^^ CIA interrogators subsequently reported subjecting Adnan al-Libi to sleep
deprivation sessions of 46.5 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours, with a combined three hours of sleep
between sessions.^^^

Beginning in late April 2004, a number of media outlets published

photographs of detainee abuse at the Department of Defense-run Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The
media reports caused members of the Committee and individuals in the executive branch to focus

on detainee issues. On May 12, 2004, the Committee held a lengthy hearing on detainee issues
with Department of Defense and CIA witnesses. The CIA used the Abu Ghraib abuses as a

contrasting reference point for its detention and interrogation activities. In a response to a
question from a Committee member, CIA Deputy Director McLaughlin said, "we are not
authorized in [the CIA program] to do anything like what you have seen in those
photographs.In response, a member of the Committee said, "I understand," and expressed
the understanding, consistent with past CIA briefings to the Committee, that the "norm" of CIA's
interrogations was "transparent law enforcement procedures [that] had developed to such a high
level... that you could get pretty much what you wanted." The CIA did not correct the
Committee member's misunderstanding that CIA interrogation techniques were similar to
techniques used by U.S. law enforcement.^^^

Techniques on an Individual Basis; Interrogations are Based on Fabricated, Single

consistent with U.S. constitutional standards.Goldsmith also raised concerns about

divergences between the CIA's proposed enhanced interrogation techniques, as described in the
August 1, 2002, memorandum, and their actual application, as described in the CIA Inspector
General's Special Review.In late May 2004, DCI Tenet suspended the use of the CIA's
"enhanced" and "standard" interrogation techniques, pending updated approvals from the
OLC.^Â®^ On June 4, 2004, DCI Tenet issued a formal memorandum suspending the use of the

CIA's interrogation techniques, pending policy and legal review.^Â®^ The same day, the CIA
sought reaffirmation of the program from the National Security Council.^^ National Security
Advisor Rice responded, noting that the "next logical step is for the Attorney General to

complete the relevant legal analysis now in preparation."^^^

CIA source who provided the information on the "pre-election" threat and implicated Gul and
others admitted to fabricating the information. However, as early as March 2004, CIA officials

internally expressed doubts about the validity ofthe CIA source's information.^Â®^

"interrogations have saved American lives," that more than half of the CIA detainees would not

cooperate until they were interrogated using the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques,and
that "unless CIA interrogators can use a full range of enhanced inteiTogation methods, it is
unlikely that CIA will be able to obtain current threat information from Gul in a timely

manner."^^^ Janat Gul was not yet in CIA custody.
On July 6, 2004, National Security Advisor Rice sent a

memorandum to DCI Tenet stating that the CIA was "permitted to use previously approved
enhanced interrogation methods for Janat Gul, with the exception of the waterboard." Rice
offered "to assist [the CIA] in obtaining additional guidance from the Attorney General and NSC
Principals on an expedited basis" and noted the CIA's agreement to provide additional
information about the waterboard technique in order for the Department of Justice to assess its
legality. Rice's memorandum further documented that the CIA had informed her that "Gul

likely has information about preelection terrorist attacks against the United States as a result of
Gul's close ties to individuals involved in these alleged plots.
In a meeting on July 20, 2004, National Security Council
principals, including the vice president, provided their authorization for the CIA to use its
enhanced interrogation techniquesâagain, with the exception of the waterboardâon Janat Gul.
They also directed the Departmentof Justice to prepare a legal opinion on whether the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques were consistent with the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to
the U.S. Constitution.On July 22, 2004, Attorney General John Ashcroft sent a letter to

Acting DCI John McLaughlin stating that nine interrogation techniques (those addressed in the
August 1, 2002, memorandum, with the exception of the waterboard) did not violate the U.S.
Constitution or any statute or U.S. treaty obligations, in the context of the interrogation of Janat

Gul.^'"^ For the remainder of2004, the CIA used its enhanced interrogation techniques on three
detaineesâJanat Gul, Sharif al-Masri, and Ahmed Khalfan Ghailaniâwith individualized

approval from the Department of Justice.^^^

experienced auditory and visual hallucinations.^'^ According to a cable, Janat Gul was "not
oriented to time or place" and told CIA officers that he saw "his wife and children in the mirror
and had heard their voices in the white noise."^^^ The questioning of Janat Gul continued,
although the CIA ceased using the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques for several days.

According to a CIA cable, "[Gul] asked to die, or justbe killed."^^^ After continued
interrogation sessions with Gul, on August 19, 2004, CIA detention site personnel wrote that the
interrogation "team does not believe [Gul] is withholding imminent threat information.On
August 21, 2004, a cable from CIA Headquarters stated that Janat Gul "is believed" to possess
threat information, and that the "use of enhanced techniques is appropriate in order to obtain that

information."^^^ On that day, August 21, 2004, CIA interrogators resumed using the CIA's

enhanced interrogation techniques against Gul.^^^ Gul continued not to provide any reporting on
the pre-election threat described by the CIA source.^^^ On August 25, 2004, CIA interrogators
sent a cable to CIA Headquarters stating that Janat Gul "may not possess all that [the CIA]
believes him to know."^^ The interrogators added that "many issues linking [Gul] to al-Qaida

are derived from single source reporting" (the CIA source).^^^ Nonetheless, CIA interrogators
continued to question Gul on the pre-election threat. According to an August 26, 2004, cable,
after a 47-hour session of standing sleep deprivation, Janat Gul was returned to his cell, allowed

to remove his diaper, given a towel and a meal, and permitted to sleep.^^^ In October 2004, the

CIA conducted a||B||B

attack planning for the pre-election threat. ||^mi|^^HI||||i> the CIA source admitted to

fabricating the information.^^^ Gul was subsequently ti^ansferred to a foreign government. On
(informed the CIA that Janat Gul had been released.^^^
Janat Gul never provided the threat information the CIA originally
told the National Security Council that Gul possessed. Nor did the use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques against Gul produce the "immediate thi-eat information that could save
American lives," which had been the basis for the CIA to seek authorization to use the

techniques. As described elsewhere in this summary, the CIA's justification for employing its
enhanced interrogation techniques on Janat Gulâthe first detainee to be subjected to the
techniques following the May 2004 suspensionâchanged over time. After having initially cited
Gul's knowledge of the pre-election threat, as reported by the CIA's source, the CIA began
representing that its enhanced interrogation techniques were required for Gul to deny the

existence of the threat, thereby disproving the credibility of the CIA source.^^^

August 11, 2004, in the midst of th^ntemjgation of Janat Gul
using the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, CIA attorney
wrote a letter
to Acting Assistant Attorney General Dan Levin with "brief biographies" of four individuals
whom the CIA hoped to detain. Given the requirement at the time that the CLA seek individual
approval from the Department of Justice before using the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques against a detainee, the CIA letter states, "[w]e are providing these preliminary
biographies in preparation for a future request for a legal opinion on their subsequent
interrogation in CIA control." Two of the individualsâAbu Faraj al-Libi and Hamza Rabi'aâ
had not yet been captured, and thus the "biographies" made no reference to their interrogations
or the need to use the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. The third individual, Abu Talha

a^akistani^a^i^oreign government custody. His debriefings by aforeign government, |
described in the letter as "only moderately effective" because Abu
Talha was "distracting [those questioning him] with noncritical information that is truthful, but is
not related to operational planning." The fourth individual, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, was also

ir^or^n government custody and being debriefed by foreign government officials
According to the letter, Ghailani's foreign government debriefings were "ineffective"
because Ghailani had "denied knowledge of current threats." The letter described reporting on
the pre-election threatâmuch of which came from the CIA sourceâin the context of all four

individuals.^^*^ Ahmed Ghailani and Abu Faraj al-Libi were eventually rendered to CIA custody
and subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.

the CIA transferred al-Masri to that government's custody after approximately thi*ee
months of CIA detention.

As in the case of Janat Gul and Sharif al-Masri, the CIA's requests

for OLC advice on the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against Ahmed
Khalfan Ghailani were based on the fabricated reporting on the pre-election threat from the same

CIA source.^^^ Like Janat Gul and Sharif al-Masri, Ghailani also experienced auditory

hallucinations following sleep deprivation.^^^ As described in this summary, after having opined
on the legality of using the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on these three individual
detainees, the OLC did not opine again on the CIA's enhanced interrogation program until May

Shortly after these discussions, CIA officers approached the

in Country | to determine if it would again be willing to host these CIA detainees, who would
remain in CIA custody within an already existing Country | facility.^'*Â® By January | , 2004, the
in Country | had agreed to this arrangement for a limited period oftime.^^^

(TS/^^BHUHI^^) Meanwhile, CIA General Counsel Scott Muller asked the

Department of Justice, the National Security Council, and the White House Counsel for advice
on whether the five CIA detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay should remain at Guantanamo

Bay or be moved pending the Supreme Court's decision.^^^ After consultation with the U.S.
solicitor general in February 2004, the Department of Justice recommended that the CIA move
four detainees out of a CIA detention facility at Guantanamo Bay pending the Supreme Court's
resolution of the case.^^^ The Department of Justice concluded that a fifth detainee, Ibn Shaykh
al-Libi, did not need to be transferred because he had originally been detained under military

authority and had been declared to the ICRC.^^"^ Nonetheless, by April

2004, all five CIA

detainees were transferred from Guantanamo Bay to other CIA detention facilities.

L. The Pace of CIA Operations Slows; Chief of Base Concerned About "Inexperienced,
Marginal, Underperforming" CIA Personnel; Inspector General Describes Lack of
Debriefers As "Ongoing Problem"

In the fall of 2004, CIA officers began considering "end games," or
the final disposition of detainees in CIA custody. A draft CIA presentation for National Security
Council principals dated August 19, 2004, identified the drawbacks of ongoing indefinite
detention by the CIA, including: the need for regular relocation of detainees, the "tiny pool of
potential host countries" available "due to high risks," the fact that "prolonged detention without
legal process increases likelihood of HVD health, psychological problems [and] curtails intel
flow," criticism of the U.S. government if legal process were delayed or denied, and the
likelihood that the delay would "complicate, and possibly reduce the prospects of successful
prosecutions of these detainees.CIA draft talking points produced a month later state that
transfer to Department of Defense or Department of Justice custody was the "preferred endgame
for 13 detainees currently in [CIA] control, none of whom we believe should ever leave USG

custody.""^^^
2004, the overwhelming majority of CIA
detaineesâ113 of the 119 identified in the Committee Studyâhad already entered CIA custody.
Most of the detainees remaining in custody were no longer undergoing active interrogations;

rather, they were infrequently questioned and awaiting a final disposition. The CIA took custody
of only six new detainees between 2005 and January 2009: four detainees in 2005, one in 2006,
and oneâthe CIA's final detainee, Muhammad Rahimâin 2007.^^^

DETENTION SITE BLACK in Country |, at the^Ifacility
in
Country I, as well as atdetention facilities in Country DETENTION SITE VIOLET in
Country | opened inearly 2005.*^^^ On April 15, 2005, the chief ofBase at DETENTION SITE
BLACK in Country | sent the management ofRDG an email expressing his concerns about the
detention site and the program in general. He commented that "we have seen clear indications
that various Headquarters elements are experiencing mission fatigue vis-a-vis their interaction
with the program," resulting in a "decline in the overall quality and level of experience of
deployed personnel," and a decline in "level and quality of requirements." He wrote that
because of the length of time most of the CIA detainees had been in detention, "[the] detainees
have been all but drained of actionable intelligence," and their remaining value was in providing
"information that can be incorporated into strategic, analytical think pieces that deal with
motivation, structiu-e and goals." The chief of Base observed that, during the course of the year,
the detention site transitioned from an intelligence production facility to a long-term detention
facility, which raised "a host of new challenges." These challenges included the need to address
CIA PowerPoint Presentation, CIA Detainees: Endgame Options and Plans, dated August 19, 2004.
September 17, 2004, DRAFT Talking Points for tlie ADCI: EndgameOptions and Plans for CIA Detainees.
The CIA took custody of Abu Faraj al-Libi, Abu Munthir al-Magrebi, Ibrahim Jan, and Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi in
2005, and Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi in 2006.

the "natural and progressive effects of long-tenn solitary confinement on detainees" and ongoing
behavioral probleras.^^^

(T8//H^^HH|//NF) With respect to the personnel at DETENTION SITE BLACK, the
chief of Base wrote:

"I am concerned at what appears to be a lack of resolve at Headquarters to
deploy to the field the brightest and most qualified officers for service at [the
detention site]. Over the course of the last year the quality of personnel
(debriefers and [security protective officers]) has declined significantly. With
regard to debriefers, most are mediocre, a handfull [sic] are exceptional and
more than a few are basically incompetent. From what we can determine there
is no established methodology as to the selection of debriefers. Rather than
look for their best, managers seem to be selecting either problem,
underperforming officers, new, totally inexperienced officers or whomever
seems to be willing and able to deploy at any given time. We see no evidence
that thought is being given to deploying an 'A-Team.' The result, quite

naturally, is the production of mediocre or, I dare say, useless intelhgence....
We have seen a similar deterioration in die quality of the security personnel
deployed to the site.... If this program truly does represent one of the agency's
most secret activities then it defies logic why inexperienced, marginal,
underperforming and/or officers with potentially significant
[counterintelligence] problems are permitted to deploy to this site. It is also
important that we immediately inact [sic] some form of rigorous training
program.

A CIA OIG audit completed in June 2006 "found that personnel
assigned to CIA-controlled detention facilities, for the most part, complied with the standards
and guidelines in carrying out their duties and responsibilities." The OIG also found that,
"except for the shortage of debriefers, the facilities were staffed with sufficient numbers and
types of personnel." The lack of debriefers, however, was described as "an ongoing problem"
for the program. According to the audit, there were extended periods in 2005 when the CIA's

DETENTION SITE ORANGE in Country | had either one or no debriefers. At least twice in
the summerof 2005, the chiefof Station in that country requested additional debriefers, warning
that intelligence collection could suffer. Months later, in January 2006, the chief of Base at the
detention site advised CIA Headquarters that "the facility still lacked debriefers to support
intelligence collection requirements, that critical requirements were 'stacking up,' and that gaps
in the debriefing of detainees were impacting the quantity and quality of intelligence reporting
and would make the work of future debriefers more difficult.

M. Legal and Operational Challenges in 2005

1. Department ofJustice Renews Approvalfor the Use of the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation
Techniques in May 2005
acting assistant attorney general for
OLC, Steven Bradbury, issued two legal memoranda. The first analyzed whether the individual
use of the CIA's 13 enhanced interrogation techniquesâincluding waterboarding, as well as a
number of interrogation techniques that had been used in 2003 and 2004, but had not been

analyzed in the original August 1, 2002, OLC memorandumâwere consistent with the criminal
prohibition on torture.^^'^ The second memorandum considered the combined use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques.^^^ Both legal memoranda concluded that the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques did not violate the torture statute.
^005, the CIA inspector general, who had been

provided with the two OLC memoranda, wrote a memo to the CIA director recommending that
the CIA seek additional legal guidance on whether the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques
and conditions of confinement met the standard under Article 16 of the Convention Against

Torture.^^^ The inspectorgeneral noted that "a strong case can be made that the Agency's
authorized intenogation techniques are the kinds of actions that Article 16 undertakes to
prevent," adding that the use of the waterboard may be "cruel" and "extended detention with no
clothing would be considered 'degrading' in most cultures, particularly Muslim." The inspector
general further urged that the analysis of conditions was equally important, noting that the
inspector general's staff had "found a number of instances of detainee treatment which arguably

violate the prohibition on cruel, inhuman, and/or degrading treatment."^^^

Committee Study, the Inspector General audit described how the CIA's detention facihties were not equipped to
provide detainees witli medical care. The audit describedunhygienic food preparation,including at a facility with a
"rodent infestation," and noted that a physician assistant attributed symptoms of acute gastrointestinal illness and
giardiasis experienced by six staff and a detainee to food and watercontamination. Tlie audit further identified
insufficient guidelines covering possible detainee escape or the death of a detainee.

On May 30, 2005, a third OLC memorandumexamining U.S.
obligations under the Convention Against Torture was completed.^^^ The conclusions in this
opinion were based largely on the CIA's representations about the effectiveness of the CIA

interrogation program in obtaining unique and "otherwise unavailable actionable intelligence."
As described later in this summary, and in more detail in Volume II, the CIA's effectiveness
representations were almost entirely inaccurate.

2. Abu Faraj Al-Libi Subjected to the CIA *s Enhanced Interrogation Techniques Prior to
Department of Justice Memorandum on U.S. Obligations Under the Convention Against
Torture; CIA Subjects Abu Faraj Al-Libi to the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation
Techniques When He Complains of Hearing Problems
Ori May 2, 2005, when Abu Faraj al-Libi, al-Qa'ida's chief of

operations, was captured in Pakistan, the OLC had not yet issued the three aforementioned May

2005 legal memoranda.^^^ CIA officers described Abu Faraj al-Libi's capture as the "most
important al-Qa'ida capture since Khalid Shaykh Muhammad."^^^ Shortly after al-Libi's
capture, the CIA began discussing the possibility that Abu Faraj al-Libi might be rendered to
U.S. custody.^^'

On May | , 2005, four days before the rendition of Abu Faraj alLibi to CIA custody, Director of CTC Robert Grenier asked CIA Director Porter Goss to send a

memorandum to the national security advisor and the director of national intelligence "informing
them of the CIA's plans to takecustody of Abu Faraj al-Libi and to employ interrogation
techniques if warranted and medically safe."^^^ On May 24, 2005, the White House informed the
CIA that a National Security Council Principals Committee meeting would be necessary to
discuss the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Faraj al-Libi, but the
travel schedule of one of the principals was delaying such a meeting.^^^ CIA Director Goss
instructed CIA officers to proceed as planned, indicating that he would call the principals
individually and inform them that, if Abu Faraj al-Libi was found not to be cooperating and there
were no contraindications to such an interrogation, he would approve the use of all of the CIA's

enhanced interrogation techniques other than the waterboard, without waiting for a meeting of

2005.^^^

on May
2005, CIA Director Goss formally notified National
Security AdvisorStephen Hadley and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) John Negroponte

that Abu Faraj al-Libi would be rendered to the unilateral custody ofthe CIA.^^^ Director Goss's
memorandum stated:

"[sjhould Abu Faraj resist cooperating in CIA debriefings, and pending a
finding of no medical or psychological contraindictations [sic], to
interrogation, I will authorize CIA trained and certified interrogators to employ
one or more of the thirteen specific interrogation techniques for which CIA
recently received two signed legal opinions from the Department of Justice
(DOJ), Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) that these techniques, both individually

andused collectively, are lawful."^^^
The memorandum from Director Goss described Abu Faraj al-Libi

as holding the third most important positionin al-Qa'ida, and "play[ing] a leading role in
directing al-Qa'ida's global operations, including attack planning against the US homeland."
Abu Faraj al-Libi was also described as possibly overseeing al-Qa'ida's "highly compartmented
anthrax efforts."^^^

On May
2005, one day after al-Libi's arrival at DETENTION
SITE BLACK, CIA interrogators received CIA Headquarters approval for the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Faraj al-Libi.CIA interrogators began using the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Faraj al-Libi on May 28, 2005, two days before
the OLC issued its memorandum analyzing whether the techniques violated U.S. obligations

complained of a loss of hearing, repeatedly telling him to stop pretending he could not hear

well.^^^ Although the interrogators indicated that they believed al-Libi's complaint was an
interrogation resistance technique, Abu Faraj al-Libi was fitted for a hearing aid after his transfer
to U.S. military custody at Guantanamo Bay in 2006.^^^ Despite the repeated and extensive use
of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Faraj al-Libi, CIA Headquarters
continued to insist throughout the summer and fall of 2005 that Abu Faraj al-Libi was
withholding information and pressed for the renewed use of the techniques. The use of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against Abu Faraj al-Libi was eventually discontinued
because CIA officers stated that they had no intelligence to demonstrate that Abu Faraj al-Libi
continued to withhold information, and because CIA medical officers expressed concern that
additional use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques "may come with unacceptable
medical or psychological risks."^^"^ After the discontinuation of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques, the CIA asked Abu Faraj al-Libi about UBL facilitator Abu Ahmad al-

Kuwaiti for the first time.^^^ Abu Faraj al-Libi denied knowledge of al-Kuwaiti.^^^
3. CIA Acquires Two Detaineesfrom the U.S. Military

Another legal issue in late 2005 was related to the U.S. Department
of Defense's involvement in CIA detention activities. In September 2005, the CIA and the

Departmentof Defense signed a Memorandum of Understanding on this subject,^^-^^ and the U.S.
military agreed to transfer two detainees, Ibrahim Jan and Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi, to CIA custody.
Both were held by the U.S. military without being registered with the ICRC for over 30 days,
pending their transfer to CIA custody.The transfer of Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi took place
notwithstanding Department of State concerns that the transfer would be inconsistent with
statements made by the secretary of state that U.S. forces in Iraq would remain committed to the

law of armed conflict, including the Geneva Conventions.^^^

In late 2005, during the period the U.S. Senate was debating the
Detainee Treatment Act baning "cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment,the

CIA subjected Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi to its enhanced interrogation techniques.^Â®^ A draft
Presidential Daily Brief (PDB) stated that Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi provided "almost no information
that could be used to locate former colleagues or disrupt attack plots"âthe type of information
sought by the CIA, and the CIA's justification for the use of its enhanced interrogation

techniques.^^^ Later, the statement that Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi provided "almost no information that
could be used to locate former colleagues or disrupt attack plots" was deleted from the draft

PDB.^Â®^ Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi remained in CIA custody until early September2006, when he was

According to CIA records, Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi was subjected to nudity, dietary manipulation, insult slaps,
abdominal slaps, attention grasps, facial holds, walling, stress positions, and water dousing with 44 degree
Fahrenheit water for 18 minutes. He was shackled in the standing position for 54 hours as part of sleep deprivation,

and experienced swelling in his lower legs requiring blood thinner and spiriil ace bandages. He was moved to a
sitting position, and his sleep deprivation was extended to 78 hours. After the swelling subsided, he was provided
with more blood thinner and was returned to the standing position. The sleep deprivation was extended to 102
hours. After four hours of sleep, Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi was subjected to an additional 52 hours of sleep deprivation,
after which CIA Headquarters infomied interrogators that eight hours was the minimum rest period between sleep

deprivation sessions exceeding 48 hours. In addition to the swelling, Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi also experienc^an edema

(TS/^^Hp||[^H|//NF) In early 2005, the CIA again sought an "endgame" policy for its
detainees, citing its unstable relations with host governments and its difficulty in identifying
additional countries to host CIA detention facilities.^Â®^ Talking points prepared for the CIA
director for a meeting with the national security advisor made the following appeal:
"CIA urgently needs [the Presidentof the United States] and Principals
Committee direction to establish a long-term disposition policy for the 12
High-Value detainees (HVD)s we hold in overseas detention sites. Our liaison

partners who host these sites are deeply concerned by [REDACTED]^Â®^ press
leaks, and they are increasingly skeptical of the [U.S. government's]
commitment to keep secret their cooperation.... A combination of press leaks,
international scrutiny of alleged [U.S. government] detainee abuse, and the
perception that [U.S. government] policy on detainees lacks direction is
eroding our partners' trust in U.S. resolve to protect their identities and
supporting roles. If a [U.S. government] plan for long-term [detainee]
disposition does not emerge soon, the handful of liaison partners who
cooperate may ask us to close down our facilities on their tenitory. Few

countries are willing to accept the huge risks associated with hosting a CIA
detention site, so shrinkage of the akeady small pool of willing candidates
could force us to curtail our highly successful interrogation and detention
program. Fear of public exposure may also prompt previously cooperative
liaison partners not to accept custody of detainees we have captured and
interrogated. Establishment of a clear, publicly announced [detainee]
'endgame' - one sanctioned by [the President of the United States] and
supported by Congress - will reduce our partners' concerns and rekindle their
enthusiasm for helping the US in the War on Terrorism."^^^
I" March 2005, talking points prepared for the CIA director for a
discussion with the National Security Council Principals Committee stated that it was:
The CIA's June 2013 Response states that an "important factor" contributing to the slowerpace of CIA detention
operations was al-Qa'ida's relocation to the FATA, which "made it significantly morechallenging [for the Pakistani
government] to mount capture operations resulting in renditionsand detentions by the RDI program." A review of
CIA records by the Committee found that legal, policy, and otheroperational concerns dominated internal

deliberations abou^e program. In 2005, CIA officers asked
one mifjfll and one HH.

officials to render two detainees to CIA
neither

detainee was transferred to CIA custody. CIA officers noted that obtaining custody of detainees held by a foreign

government during this period was becoming increasingly difficult, highlighting diat IHlHjHHliiHIHH
In March 2006, Director

Goss testified to the Committee thatlack(rfspacewas the limiting factor in taking custody of additional detainees.

During this period, the U.S. solicitor general, however, expressed
concern that if CIA detainees were transferred back to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, they might be

Security Council continued to discuss a public roll-out, and as described later in this summaiy,

the CIA engaged the media directly in order todefend and promote the program.^^Â®
The question of what to do with the remaining detainees in CIA
custody remained unresolved throughout 2005, during which time the CIA pursued agreements
with additional countries to establish clandestine CIA detention facilities.^'^ The Detainee

prepar^ther options.^^^ Meanwhile, two U.S. ambassadors, one in

inquired whether Secretary of State Rice had been briefed on the impending
Washington Post article and sought to speak to the secretary herself to ensure that the CIA

specific countries where the CIA detention facilities were located.^^^ In lieu of a phone call from
Secretary Rice, the CIA recommended that the State Department's CounterteiTorism Coordinator

and former CTC DDO, Henry Crumpton, call the ambassadors.^^^ The Washington Post

which the CIA

anticipated would release thedetainees after a short period. The CIA also proposed its own outright release of the

By the time a CIA team visited the Country | detention site inlate
2006, the CIA had akeady invested $B million in the new facility. Describing the absence of
adequate emergency medical care options as "unacceptable," the chief of RDG recommended in

a draft memo thatconstruction efforts beabandoned for this reason.^^Â® The following day, an
edited version of the same memo described the issue as a "challenge," but did not recommend

that the CIA cease constm^ion of the facility.^^^ The resulting CIA detention facility, which

would eventually cost $|H million, was never used b^he CIA. Press reports about the CIA's
Detention and Interrogation Program that appeared in ||^| and m eventually forced the CIA
to pass possession of theunused facility to the Countryy|g(
| government. 952
In early January 2006, officials at the Department of Defense
informed CIA officers that Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld had made a formal decision not to

accept any CIA detainees at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.^^^ At the time, the
CIA was holding 28 detainees in its two remaining facilities, DETENTION SITE VIOLET, in

Country |, and DETENTION SITE ORANGE, in Country

In preparation for a meeting

with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld on January 6, 2006, CIA Director Goss was provided a
document indicating that the Department of Defense's position not to allow the transfer of CIA

detainees to U.S. military custody at Guantanamo Bay "would cripple legitimate end game

planning" for the CIA.^^^ The talking points for that meeting suggested that Director Goss tell
Secretary Rumsfeld that the:

"only viable 'endgame' for continued US Government custody of these most
dangerous terrorists is a transfer to GTMO... [a]bsent the availability of
GTMO and eventual DoD custody, CIA will necessarily have to begin
transferring those detainees no longer producing intelligence to third countries,

to provide inpatient care for detainees," and concluded that CIA detention facilities were not equipped to provide
emergency medical care to detainees. The audit team did not visit the facility in Country but stated, with regard

to another country, Country |, that "CIA funds have been wasted in constructing and equipping a medical facility
that was later determined not to be a viable option for providing inpatient care for detainees." See Reportof Audit,

which may release them, or [the CIA itself may need to] outright release
them."^^^

After Secretary Rumsfeld declined to reconsider his decision not to
allow the transfer of CIA detainees to U.S. military custody at Guantanamo Bay, CIA officers
proposed elevating the issue to the president. CIA officers prepared talking points for Director

Goss to meet with the president onthe "Way Forward" onthe program on January 12, 2006.^^^
The talking points recommended that the CIA director "stress that absent a decision on the longterm issue (so called 'endgame') we are stymied and the program could collapse of its own

weight."^''^ There are no records to indicate whether Director Goss made this presentation to the
president.
2005 and 2006, the CIA transferred detainees from its custody to

at least nine countries, includinji
as well as to the U.S. military in Iraq. Many of these

detainees were subsequently released.^^^ By May 2006, the CIA had 11 detainees whom it had
identified as candidates for prosecution by a U.S. military commission. The remaining detainees

were described as having "repatriation options open."^^Â°
6. The CIA Considers Changes to the CIA Detention and Interrogation Program Following
the Detainee Treatment Act, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld

Following the passage of the Detainee Treatment Act in December
2005, the CIA conducted numerous discussions with the National Security Council principals
about modifications to the program that would be acceptable from a policy and legal standpoint.

In February 2006, talking points prepared for CIA Director Goss noted that National Security
Advisor Stephen Hadley:
"asked to be informed of the criteria CIA will use before accepting a detainee
into its CIA Counterten-orist Rendition, Detention, and InteiTOgation Program,

stating that he believed CIA had in the past accepted detainees it should not
have."^^^

The CIA director proposed future criteria that would require not

only that CIA detainees meet the standard in the MON, but that they possess information about
threats to the citizens of the United States or otiier nations, and that detention in a CIA facility

wa^pprapriate for intelligence exploitation.^^^ Afew months later,

Legal,

wrote to Acting Assistant Attorney General Steven Bradbury suggesting a
modified standard for applying the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. The suggested new

standard was that "the specific detainee is believed to possess critical intelligence of high value
to the United States." While the proposed modification included the requirement that a detainee
have "critical intelligence of high value," it represented an expansion of CIA authorities, insofar
as it covered the detention and interrogation of an individual with information that "would assist

in locating the most senior leadership of al-Qa'ida of [sic] an associated terrorist organization,"
even if that detainee was not assessed to have knowledge of, or be directly involved in, imminent
terrorist threats.^^^

Discussions with the National Security Council principals also
resulted in a March 2006 CIA proposal for an interrogation program involving only seven of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques: sleep deprivation, nudity, dietary manipulation, facial

grasp, facial slap, abdominal slap, and the attention grab.^^"^ This proposal was not acted upon at
the time. The proposal for sleep deprivation of up to 180 hours, however, raised concerns among
the National Security Council principals.^^^
In April 2006, the CIA briefed the president on the "current status"
of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. According to an internal CIA review, this
was the first time the CIA had briefed the president on the CIA's enhanced interrogation

techniques.^^^ As previously noted, the president expressed concern at the April 2006 briefing
about the "image of a detainee, chained to the ceiling, clothed in a diaper, and forced to go to the
bathroom on himself."^*^^

On June 29, 2006, the Supreme Court issued its decision in the

Hamdan, a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, was inconsistent with statutory requirements and
Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. The implication of the decision was that treating
a detainee in a manner inconsistent with the requirements of Common Article 3 would constitute
a violation of federal criminal law. CIA attorneys analyzed the Hamdan decision, noting that it
could have a significant impact on "current CIA interrogation practices.Their memorandum
also referenced that Acting Assistant Attorney General Steven Bradbury had the "preliminary
view ... that the opinion 'calls into real question' whether CIA could continue its CT
interrogation program involving enhanced interrogation techniques," as the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques "could be construed as inconsistent with the provisions of Common

Article 3 prohibiting 'outrages upon personal dignity' and violence to life and person."^^^
The case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld prompted the OLC to withdraw a
draft memorandum on the impact of the Detainee Treatment Act on the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques.^^Â® The CIA did not use its enhanced inten-ogation techniques again
until July 2007, by which time the OLC had interpreted the Military Commissions Act, signed by
the president on October 17, 2006, in such a way as to allow the CIA to resume the use of the
techniques.^^^
N. The Final Disposition of CIA Detainees and the End of the CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program

L President Bush Publicly Acknowledges the Existence of the CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program

After significant discussions throughout 2006 among the National
Security Council principals, the Department of Defense ultimately agreed to accept the transfer
of a number of CIA detainees to U.S. military custody

(U) On September 6, 2006, President George W. Bush delivered a public speech acknowledging
that the United States had held al-Qaida operatives in secret detention, stating that the CIA had
employed an "alternative set of procedures" in interrogating these detainees, and describing
information obtained from those detainees while in CIA custodyAs described later in this
summary, the speech, which was based on CIA information and vetted by the CIA, contained
CIA memorandum from tlie CIA's Office of General Counsel, circa June 2006, entitled, "Hamdan v. Rumsfeld."

significant inaccurate statements, especially regarding the significance of information acquired
from CIA detainees and the effectiveness of the CIA's interrogation techniques.
(U) In the speech, the president announced the transfer of 14detainees to Department of
Defense custody at Guantanamo Bay and the submission to Congress of proposed legislation on

military commissions.^^^ As all other detainees in the CIA's custody had been transferred to
other nations, the CIA had no detainees in its custody at the time of the speech.^^^
2. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Gains Access to CIA Detainees
After Their Transfer to U.S. Military Custody in September 2006
After the 14 CIA detainees arrived at the U.S. military base at

Guantanamo Bay, they were housed in a separate building from other U.S. military detainees and
remained under the operational control of the CIA.^^^ In October 2006, the 14 detainees were
allowed meetings with the ICRC and described in detail similar stories regarding their detention,
treatment, and interrogation while in CIA custody. The ICRC provided information on these

claims to the CIA.^^^ Acting CIA General CounselJohn Rizzo emailed tiie CIA director and
other CIA senior leaders, following a November 8, 2006, meeting with the ICRC, stating:
"[a]s described to us, albeit in summary form, what the detainees allege
actually does not sound that far removed from the reality... the ICRC, for its
part, seems to find their stories largely credible, having put much stock in the
fact that the story each detainee has told about his transfer, treatment and

conditions of confinement was basically consistent, even though they had been
incommunicado with each otherthroughout their detention by us."^^^
In February 2007 the ICRC transmitted to the CIA its final report
on the "Treatment of Fourteen 'High Value Detainees' in CIA Custody." The ICRC report
concluded that "the ICRC clearly considers that the allegations of the fourteen include
descriptions of treatment and interrogation techniques - singly or in combination - that amounted

to torture and/orcruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."^^Â® Notwithstanding Rizzo's comments,
the CIA disagreed with a number of the ICRC's findings, provided rebuttals to the ICRC in

abuses and faulty legal assumptions and analysis in the report undermine its overall
credibility.The ICRC report was acquired by The New York Review of Books and posted on

the Review'?, website in April 2009.^*^^ The Committee found theICRC report to be largely
consistent with information contained in CIA interrogation records.^^^
3. The CIA Considers Future of the Program Following the Military Commissions Act

noted, in June 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court case of Hamdan v.
Rumsfeld prompted the OLC to withdraw a draft legal memorandum on the impact of the

Detainee Treatment Act on the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.^^"^ The administration
determined that the CIA would need new legislation to continue to use the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques.The Military Commissions Act addressed the issues raised by the
Hamdan decision and provided the president the authority to issue an Executive Order detailing
permissible conduct under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. The bill passed the

Senate on September 28, 2006, and the House ofRepresentatives the following day.^^^

On November |, 2006, when Abd Kadi al-Iraqi was rendered to
CIA custody, the draft Executive Order and an updated OLC memorandum had not yet been

prepared.^^^ Although Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi was consistently assessed as being cooperative,

John Rizzo; subject: FW: Summary

Acting Assistant Attorney General Bradbury told tlie Department of Justice's Office of Professional
Responsibility (OPR) that officialsfrom the Departments of State, Defense, and Justice met with the president and
officials from the CIA and the NSC to consider the impact of the Hamdan decision, and that it was clear from tlie
outset that legislation would have to be enacted to address the application of Common Article 3 and the War Crimes
Act to the CIA interrogation program. As the OPR report noted, ''Hamdan directly contradicted OLC's January 22,

2002 opinion to the White House and the Department ofDefense, which had concluded that Common Article 3did
not apply to captured members of al Qaeda." See Department of Justice Officeof Professional Responsibility;

interrogators also believed he was withholding information on operational plots and the locations

ofhigh-value targets.^^^ The CIA believed his

February 2007 supported this

conclusion,prompting discussions at CIA Headquarters about the possible use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques against him. By the end of the month, however, the CIA had
determined there was "insufficient intelligence...that [Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi] possesses actionable

information... to justify the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.

(TS//^|||||||||||||||||||||||/^^) In October 2006, a panel of CIA interrogators recommended that
four CIA enhanced interrogation techniquesâthe abdominal slap, cramped confinement, nudity,
and the waterboardâ^be eliminated, but that the remainder of the interrogation techniques be

retained.^^^ Under this proposal, the CIA would have been authorized to subject detainees to
dietary manipulation, sleep deprivation, the facial slap, the facial grasp, the attention grab,
walling, stress positions, and water dousing. There are few CIA records describing the panel's
deliberations, or the CIA's response to its recommendations. The panel proposed dropping two
of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniquesânudity and the abdominal slapâthat the CIA
director had proposed retaining in March 2006, while recommending that the CIA retain three
other techniquesâ walling, stress positions, and water dousingâthat had not otherwise been
requested for retention.^^^

4. The CIA Develops Modified Enhanced Interrogation Program After Passage of the
Military Commissions Act

Iri the spring of 2007, the OLC completed a draft of a legal opinion
concluding that the use of the CIA's seven proposed enhanced interrogation techniquesâsleep
deprivation, nudity, dietary manipulation, facial grasp, facial slap, abdominal slap, and the
attention grabâwould be consistent with the requirements of Common Article 3 of the Geneva

Conventions and the Military Commissions Act. This draft generated significant disagreement
between the State Department's legal advisor, John Bellinger, and the Acting Assistant Attorney
General Steven Bradbury, resulting in Secretary of State Rice refusing to concur with the
proposed Executive Order.

2007, in an effort to gain Secretary Rice's support, the CIA
asked CIA contractors SWIGERT and DUNBAR to brief Secretary Rice on the CIA's

inten'ogation program. During that briefing, Secretary Rice expressed her concern about the use
of nudity and a detainee being shackled in the standing position for the purpose of sleep
deprivation. According to CIA records, in early July 2007, after the capture of Muhammad
Rahim, Secretary Rice indicated that she would not concur with an interrogation program that
included nudity, but that she would not continue to object to the CIA's proposed interrogation
program if it was reduced to six of the enhanced inteiTogation techniques listed in the draft OLC
memorandum: (1) sleep deprivation, (2) dietary manipulation, (3) facial grasp, (4) facial slap,

(5) abdominal slap, and (6) the attention grab.^^'^
5. Muhammad Rahim, the CIA's Last Detainee, is Subjected to Extensive Use of the CIA's
Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, Provides No Intelligence
On June 25, 2007, al-Qa'ida facilitator Muhammad Rahim was

captured in Pakistan.^^^ Based on reports of debriefings of Rahim in foreign government custody
and other intelligence, CIA personnel assessed that Rahim likely possessed information related

to the location of Usama bin Laden and other al-Qa'ida leaders.^^^ On July 3, 2007, Acting CIA
General Counsel John Rizzo informed Acting Assistant Attorney General Steven Bradbury that
the CIA was anticipating a "new guest," and that the CIA "would need the signed DOJ opinion

'in a matterof days.'"^^^
Muhammad Rahim was rendered to CIA custody at DETENTION

SITE BROWN in Country | on

B 2007."Â® Upon his arrival, CIA

interrogators had a single discussion with Rahim during which he declined to provide answers to
questions about threats to the United States and the locations of top al-Qa'ida leaders.Based
on this interaction, CIA interrogators reported that Rahim was unlikely to be cooperative. As a
and agree tlieCIA is off the track and rails... that we shouldnot be doingdetention, rendition, interrogation."
Referringto a CIA leadershipmeeting that day in which the Committee's April 12, 2007, hearing would be

result, CIA DirectorMichael Hayden senta letter to the president formally requesting that the
president issue the Executive Order interpreting the Geneva Conventions in a manner to allow

the CIA to interrogateRahim using the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. A classified
legal opinion from OLC concluding that the use of the CIA's six enhanced interrogation
techniques proposed for use on Rahim (sleep deprivation, dietary manipulation, facial grasp,
facial slap, abdominal slap, and the attention grab) did not violate applicable laws was issued on
July 20, 2007. The accompanying unclassified Executive Orderwas issued the same day.^Â®^Â®
Although Rahim had been described by the CIA as "one of a handful of al-Qa'ida facilitators

working directly for Bin Ladin and Zawahiri,"^Â®Â®^ Rahim remained in a CIA cell without being
questioned for a week, while CIA intenrogators waited for approval to use the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques against him.^'^^^
CIA interrogators initially expressed optimism about their ability to
acquire information from Rahim using the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. A cable
sent from the CIA detention site stated:

"Senior interrogators on site, with experience in almost every HVD [highvalue detainee] interrogationconducted by [CIA], believe the employment of
interrogation with measures would likely provide the impetus to shock
[Rahim] from his current resistance posture and provide an opportunity to
influence his behavior to begin truthful participation."'^Â®^
Pour CIA interrogators present at the CIA detention site began

applying the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on July 21, 2007.^Â®"'^ According to CIA
records, the interrogators "employedinterrogation measures of facial slap, abdominal slap, and
facial hold, and explained to [Rahim] that his assumptions of how he would be treated were

wrong."'Â®Â®^ The inteiTogators emphasized to Rahim that"his situation was the result of his
deception, he would stay in this position until interrogators chose to remove him from it, and he

could always correct a previous misstatement."^Â®Â®^ According to the cable describing the
interrogation, Rahim then threatened to fabricate information:

"[Rahim] reiterated several times during the session that he would make up
information if interrogators pressured him, and that he was at the complete

mercy of the interrogators and they could even kill him if they wanted.
InteiTogators emphasized to [Rahim] that they would not allow him to die
because then he could not give them information, but that he would,
eventually, tell interrogators the truth.

During the interrogation of Rahim using the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques, Rahim was subjected to eight extensive sleep deprivation sessions,

as well as to the attention grasp, facial holds, abdominal slaps, and the facial slap.^Â®^^ During
sleep deprivation sessions, Rahim was usually shackled in a standing position, wearing a diaper
and a pair of shorts.Rahim's diet was almost entirely limited to water and liquid Ensure
meals.CIA interrogators would provide Rahim with a cloth to further cover himself as an
incentive to cooperate. For example, a July 27, 2007, cable from the CIA detention site states
that when Rahim showed a willingness to engage in questioning about "historical information,"

he was "provided a large towel tocover his torso" as a "subtle reward."^Â®'^ CIA interrogators
asked Rahim a variety of questions during these interrogations, seeking information about the
current location of senior al-Qa'ida leaders, which he did not provide.

1007

2467(211341ZJUL07)

Rahimwas subjected to 104.5hours of sleep deprivation from July 21, 2007, to July 25, 2007. Sleep
deprivation was stopped when Rahim "describedvisual and auditory hallucinations." After Raliim was allowed to
sleepfor eight hours and the psychologist concluded that Rahim had beenfaking his symptoms, Raliim was

subjected toanother 62 hours of sleep deprivation. Athird, 13 hour session, was haltedduet^ limit of 180 hours

determined that "[tjermination at this point is required to be consistent witli theDCIA Guidelines, whichlimt sleep

deprivation to an aggregate of180 hours in any repeat any 30 day period." {See HEADQUARTERS ^H|[|

On September 8, 2007, CIA Director Hayden approved an
extension of MuJiammad Rahim's CIA detention

The Director of the National Clandestine

Service Jose Rodriguez disagreed with the approved extension, writing:
"I did not sign because I do not concur with extending Rahim's detention for
another 60 days. I do not believe the tools in our tool box will allow us to

overcome Rahim's resistance techniques. J.A.R."^^^^
Shortly after the September 2007 extension, CIA personnel were
directed to stop the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on Rahim. Rahim was

then left in his cell with minimal contact with CIA personnel for approximately six weeks.
On September 10, 2007, Rahim's interrogators reported to CIA Headquarters that Rahim had
"demonstrated that the physical coiTective measures available to HVDIs^'^'^ have become

predictable and beaiable."^^^^ The use ofthe CIA's enlianced interrogation techniques on Rahim
resumed on November 2, 2007, with a sleep deprivation session that lasted until November 8,

2007, for a total of 138.5 hours. This sleep deprivation session, the longest to which Rahimhad
been subjected, was his eighth and final session. Rahim was also subjected to dietary
manipulation during this period.

According to CIA records, intermittent questioning of Rahim

continued until December 9, 2007, when all questioning of Rahim ceased for nearly three weeks.
During this time, CIA detention site personnel discussed and proposed new ways to encourage
Rahim's cooperation. These new proposals included suggestions that Rahim could be told that
audiotapes of his interrogations might be passed to his family, or that

Grayson SWIGERT recommended two approaches. The first was increasing Raliim's amenities over 8-14 days
"before returning to the useof EITs." The second was"switching from an interrogation approach thatin effect
amounts to a 'battle of wills,' to a 'recruiting' approach that sidesteps theadversarial contest inherent inframing the
session as an interrogation." SWIGERT noted, however, that thelatter approach "is apt to be slow in producing
information" since intelligence requirements would not be immediately serviced, and "it would work best if [Rahim]

6. CIA After-Action Review of Rahim Interrogation Callsfor StudyofEffectiveness of
Interrogation Techniques and Recommends Greater Use ofRapport-Building Techniques
in Future CIA Interrogations

On April 21, 2008, and April 22, 2008, the CIA's RDG convened
an after-action review of the CIA's interrogation of Muhammad Rahim. According to summary

documents, the CIA review panel attempted to determine why the CIA had been unsuccessful in
acquiring useful information from Rahim. The summary documents emphasized that the
primary factors thatcontributed to Rahim's unresponsiveness were the interrogation team's lack
of knowledge of Rahim, the decision to use the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques
immediately after the short "neutral probe" and subsequent isolation period, the lack of clarity
about whether the non-coercive techniques described in the Army Field Manual were permitted,
the team's inability to confront Rahim with incriminating evidence, and the use of multiple
improvised interrogation approaches despite the lack of any indication that these approaches
might be effective.The summary documents recommended that future CIA interrogations
should incorporate rapport-building techniques, social interaction, loss of predictability, and
deception to a greater extent.The documents also recommended that the CIA conduct a

CIA contractors SWIGERT and DUNBAR, who played a central
role in the development of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques in the summer of 2002,
and then used the techniques as contract interrogators, formed a company in 2005
["Company
In addition to providing interrogators for the CIA's interrogation program,
Company Y was granted a sole source contract to provide operational psychologists, debriefers,
and security personnel at CIA detention sites.Under the contract. Company Y was tasked
with conducting ongoing conversations with CIA detainees to learn about the terrorist mind set

(this project was named the "Terrorist Think Tank" or "T-^"), developing
strategies, and writing the history of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.Later

8. The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program Ends

(U) On December 5, 2007, fewer than nine months after Director Hayden told the European
Union that the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program was not a CIA program, but
"America's program," the House-Senate conference for the Fiscal Year 2008 Intelligence
Authorization Act voted to include an amendment that banned coercive interrogation techniques
and established the Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations as the
interrogation standard for all U.S. government interrogations.The conference report passed
both the House and the Senate with bipartisan majorities.
(U) On March 8, 2008, President Bush vetoed the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2008 that banned coercive interrogations. In a radio address explaining the decision, the
president stated "[t]he bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in
the war on terrorâthe CIA program to detain and question key terrorist leaders and operatives."
Addressing the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, President Bush stated that
the "main reason" the CIA program "has been effective is that it allows the CIA to use
specialized interrogation procedures to question a small number of the most dangerous terrorists
under careful supervision." The president stated that the CIA program had a "proven track
record," and that the CIA obtained "critical intelligence" as a result of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques related to the Camp Lemonier plotting, the Karachi plotting, the Second
Wave plotting, and the Heathrow Airport plotting. The president then repeated a warning the
CIA had previously provided to the White House, that to "restrict the CIA to [interrogation]
methods in the [Army] Field Manual," "could cost American lives."^^"^ As is described in this
summary, and detailed more extensively in the full Conmiittee Study, the CIA's representations
to the White House regarding the role of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques in the
thwarting of the referenced plots were inaccurate.

(U) On March 11, 2008, by a vote of 225-188, the House of Representatives failed to override
the presidential veto.^^"^^

(TS//^||||||||||||||H[//NF) In December 2008 and January 2009, CIA officers briefed the
transition team for President-elect Barack Obama on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation
Program. CIA Director Hayden prepared a statement that relayed, "despite what you have heard
or read in a variety of public fora, these [enhancedinterrogation] techniques and this program did

work."^^^ The prepared materials included inaccurate information on the operation and
management of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, as well as the same set of
examples of the "effectiveness" of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques that the CIA had
provided to policymakers over several years.The examples provided were nearly entirely
inaccurate.

On January 22, 2009, President Obama issued Executive Order
13491, which required the CIA to "close as expeditiously as possible any detention facilities that
it currently operates and... not operate any such detention facility in the future." The Executive
Order prohibited any U.S. government employee from using inten'ogation techniques other than

involve the use of force, threats, or promises." (See Executive Order 13491, "Ensuring Lawful Interrogation,'

III. Intelligence Acquired and CIA Representations on the Effectiveness of
the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation Techniques to Multiple
Constituencies

A. Background on CIA Effectiveness Representations
From 2002 through 2009, in order to obtain policy authorizations
and legal approvals, the CIA made a series of representations to officials at the White House,

the Department of Justice, and the Congress, asserting that the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques were uniquely effective and necessary to produce otherwise unavailable intelligence
that the U.S. government could not obtain from other sources.The CIA further represented
1049 These representations were also made by the CIA to other elements of the executive branch, to include the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence. As described in this Study, the Department of Justice first approved
the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on August 1, 2002.

1050

2003 through 2009, the CIA's representations regarding theeffectiveness of the CIA'senhanced

interrogation techniques provided a specificset of examples of terrorist plots "disrupted" and terroristscaptured that
the CIA attributed to information obtained from the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques. CIA
representations further asserted that the intelligence obtained from the use of tlie CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques was unique, otherwise unavailable, and resulted in "saved lives." Among other CIA representations, see:
(I) CIA representations in the Department of Justice Officeof Legal Counsel Memorandum, dated May 30, 2005,
which relied on a series of highly specific CIA representations on the type of intelligence acquired from the use of
tlieCIA's enhanced interrogation techniques to assess their legality. The CIA representations referenced by the

OLC include that the use ofthe CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was "necessary" to obtain "critic^,"
"vital," and "otherwise unavailable actionable intelligence" that was "essential"for the U.S. government to "detect
and disrupt" terrorist threats. The OLC memorandum further states that "[the CIA] ha[s] informed [the OLC] that
the CIA believes that this program is largely responsible for preventing a subsequent attack within the United
States." {See Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Senior Deputy General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, from
Steven G. Bradbury, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, May 30, 2005, Re:
Application of UnitedStates Obligations UnderArticle 16 of the Convention Against Tortureto CertainTechniques
that May Be Used in the Interrogation of High Value al Qaeda Detainees.) (2) CIA representations in the
Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum dated July 20, 2007, which also relied on CIA
representations on the type of intelligence acquired from the use of the CIA's enhancedinterrogation techniques.
CitingCIA documents and the President's September 6, 2006, speech describing die CIA's interrogation program
(which was basedon CIA-provided information), the OLC memorandum states: "The CIA interrogation programâ
and, in particular, its use of enhanced interrogation techniquesâis intended to serve this paramount interest [security
of the Nation] by producing substantial quantities of otherwise unavailable inteUigence. ...As the President
explained [on September6, 2006], 'by givingus information about ten-orist plans we could not get anywhere else,
the program has saved innocentlives.'" {See Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel, Central
Intelligence Agency, from Steven G. Bradbury, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal
Counsel, July 20, 2007, Re: Application of the War Crimes Act, the Detainee Treatment Act, and Common Article 3
of the Geneva Conventions to Certain Techniques that MayBe Used by theCIAin the Interrogation of High Value
al Qaeda Detainees.) (3) CIAbriefings for members of the National Security Council in July andSeptember 2003
represented that "the use of Enhanced Techniques of one Icind or anotherhad produced significant intelligence
information that had, in the view of CIAprofessionals, saved hves," and which warned policymakers that
"[t]ermination of this program will result in lossof life, possiblyextensive." {See August 5, 2003 Memorandum for
the Record from Scott Muller, Subject: Review of Interrogation Program on 29 July 2003; Briefing slides, CIA
Interrogation Program, July 29, 2003; September 4, 2003, CIA Memorandum for the Record, Subject: Member
Briefing; and September 26, 2003, Memorandum for the Record from Muller, Subject: CIA Interrogation Program.)
(4) The CIA's response to the Office of Inspector General draft Special Review of the CIA program, which asserts:
"Information [the CIA] received... as a resultof the lawful use of enhancedinterrogation techniques ('EITs') has
almost certainly savedcountless American lives inside the United States and abroad. The evidence points clearly to

that the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques "saved lives" and "enabled the CIA to disrupt
teiTorist plots, capture additional terrorists, and collect a high volume of critical intelligence on

al-Qa'ida."^^^' The Departmentof Justice used these representations of effectiveness to assess
the fact tliat without the use of such techniques, we and our allies would [have] suffered major terrorist attacks

involvinghundreds, if not thousands, of casualties." (SeeMemorandum for: InspectorGeneral; from: James Pavitt,
Deputy Directorfor Operations; subject: re (S) Commentsto Draft IG SpecialReview, "Counterterrorism Detention
and Interrogation Program" 2003-7123-lG; date: February 27, 2004; attachment: February 24, 2004, Memorandum
re Successes of CIA's Counterterrorism Detention and InteiTogation Activities.) (5) CIA briefing documents for
CIA Director Leon Panetta in February 2009, which state that the "CIA assesses that the RDI program worked and
the [enhanced interrogation] techniques were effective in producing foreign intelligence," and that "[m]ost, if not all,
of the timely intelligence acquiredfrom detainees in this program would not have been discovered or reported by
other means." {See CIA briefing documents for Leon Panetta, entitled, "Tab 9: DCIA Briefing on RDI Program18FEB.2009" and graphic attachment, "Key Intelligence andReporting Derived from Abu Zubaydah and Klialid
Shaykli Muhammad (KSM)," including"DCIA Briefing on RDI Program" agenda, CIA document "EITs and

March 18,2009, entitled, "[SWIGERT] and [DUNBAR]" (DTS #2009-1258), which provides a list of "some of the
key captures and disrupted plots" that the CIA had attributedto the use of the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation
techniques, and states: "CIA assesses that most, if not all, of the timelyintelligence acquired from detainees in this
program wouldnot have been discovered or reportedby any other means." See VolumeII for additional CIA
representations assertingthat tlie CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques enabled die CIA to obtain unique,
otherwise unavailable intelligence that "saved lives."

CIA presentations to the executive and legislative branches, the

CIA represented that other parties had consented to, or endorsed, the CIA's interrogation
program. As an example, during a policy review of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques
in July 2003, the CIA informed a subset of the National Security Council principals that theuse
of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was "approved by the attorney general," and was
"fully disclosed to the SSCI and HPSCI leadership." In the same presentation, the CIA
represented that the CIA interrogation program "had produced significant intelligence
information that had, in the view of CIA professionals, saved lives." The CIA then provided
examples of "attacks averted" as a direct result of the CIA interrogation program, and warned
policymakers that "[t]ermination of this program will resultin loss of life, possibly
extensive."'^^^

When the CIA was asked by White House officials to review and

provide further evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques in
2004, the CIA responded that it was "difficult, if not impossible" to conduct such a review, but
assured White House officials that "this program works," "the techniques are effective," and the

program produces "results."^Â®^^ The "results" provided by the CIA consisted ofthe "disruption"
of specific terrorist plots and the capture of specific terrorists. The CIA further represented that
the information acquired as a result of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was unique
and "otherwise unavailable.These specific CIA claims played an especially important role

and, in particular, its use of enhanced interrogation techniquesâis intended to servetliispaiamount interest [security
of the Nation] by producing substantial quantitiesof otherwise unavailable intelligence. ...As the President
explained [on September 6, 2006], *by giving us information about terrorist plans wecouldnot get anywhere else,

(4) Tlie CIA's response to the Office of InspectorGeneral draft Special Review of the CIA program, which asserts:
"Infomiation [the CIA] received... as a result of the lawful use of enhanced interrogation techniques ('EITs') has

almost certainly saved countless American lives inside the United States and abroad. The evidencepoints clearly to
the fact tliat without tlie use of such techniques, we and our allies would [have] suffered major terrorist attacks

involving hundreds, if not thousands, of casualties." (See Memorandum for: Inspector General; from: James Pavitt,
Deputy Director for Operations; subject: re (S) Comments to Draft IG Special Review, "Countertenorism Detention

means." (See CIA briefing documents for Leon Panetta, entitled, "Tab 9: DCIA Briefing on RDI Piogram18FEB.2009" and graphic attachment, "Key Intelligence and Reporting Derived from Abu Zubaydah and Khaiid

representations in determining that the CIA's enhanced intenogation techniques did not violate the Fifth
Amendment's prohibition on executive conduct that "shocks the conscience," indicating that this analysis was a
"highly context-specific and fact-dependent question." Tlie OLC also linked its analysis of whetherthe use of tlie
CIA's enhanced intenogation techniques was "constitutionally arbitrary" to the representation by the CIA that the
program produced "substantial quantities of otlierwise unavailable actionable intelligence." (See Memorandum for

interrogation techniques was a "highly context-specific, fact-dependent question" and
highlighted the importance of the CIA representation that the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques produced "substantialquantities of otherwise unavailable actionable intelligence,"
and were "largely responsible for preventing a subsequent attack within the United States.
B. Past Efforts to Review the Effectiveness of the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation
Techniques

During the period in which the CIA's Detention and Interrogation
Program was operational, from 2002 to 2009, there were three reviews that addressed the

effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques: (1) the CIA Office of Inspector
General Special Review, released in May 2004; (2) an internal review conducted by two senior
CIA officers in 2004; and (3) a 2005 "Blue Ribbon" panel consisting of two individuals not
employed by the CIA. According to CIA records, as of the spring of 2007, the CIA had not
"conducted any other studies on the effectiveness of interrogation techniques."^Â®^^
Each of the previous reviews relied on interviews with CIA

personnel involved in the program, as well as documents prepared by CIA personnel, which
represented that the CIA interrogation program was effective, and that the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques had "enabled the CIA to disrupt terrorist plots, capture

Obligations Under Article 16 of the Convention AgainstTorture to Certain Techniques that May be Used in the
Interrogation of High Value A1 Qaeda Detainees.) The CIA provided examples of the purported effectiveness of the

CIA^^nhanced interroeatioiHech^ues in response to arequest from the OLC. According to an email ftom H
mCTC Legal
Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven Bradbury explained that
"because the standards under Article 16 [of the Convention Against Torture] require a balancing of the
government's need for the information, it would be quite helpful if we had any case studies or examples to

demonstrate the value ofinformation produced by the program." 5eeemail^romj^^B|J|||(; to:

and July 20, 2007. The May 30, 2005, OLC memorandum repeats additional CIA representations, including that
"enhanced interrogation techniques remain essential to obtaining vital intelligence necessary to detect and disrupt
such emerging threats" and that the use of the techniques "led to specific, actionableintelligence." The July 20,
2007, OLC memorandum states that the "...use of enhanced interrogation techniques is intended to service this
paramount interest [security of the Nation] by producing substantial quantities of otherwise unavailable
intelligence," citing CIA representations to the President that the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques produced
information "we could not get anywhere else," andthat "the use of suchtechniques saved American lives by
revealing information about planned terrorist plots."

See CIA draft response to Questions for the Record submitted by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
after an April 12, 2007,hearing on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. The CIA draft response states
the CIA Blue Ribbon Panel, consistingof two outside reviewers, was the only independent review of the
effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques, and that "CIA had not conducted any other studies on
the effectiveness of [the] interrogation techniques." The final CIA response to tlie Committee states: "The 2004

CIA Officeof the InspectorGeneral reportthat reviewed CIA's counterterrorism detention and interrogation
activities recommended a non-CIA independent experts' review of the effectiveness of each of the authorized EFT

and a determination regarding thenecessiw for the continue^iseofeach technique. As a result, CIA sought and

obtained the agreement ofMr. |||||||||||||||||||||||| and Mr.

to conduct an independent review, which is

also known as the Blue-Ribbon Panel report. Their individual reports are provided at Tabs A and B."

additional terrorists, and collect a high-volume ofcritical intelligence on al-Qa'ida."^Â®^' CIA
personnel represented: "[t]his is information that CTC could not have gotten any other way."^Â°^^
There ai e no indications in CIA records that any of the past

reviews attempted to independently validate the intelligence claims related to the CIA's use of its
enhanced interrogation techniques that were presented by CIA personnel in interviews and in
documents. As such, no previous review confirmed whether the specific intelligence cited by the
CIA was acquired from a CIA detainee during or after being subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques, or if the intelligence acquired was otherwise unknown to the United
States government ("otherwise unavailable"), and therefore uniquely valuable.
C. The Origins of CIA Representations Regarding the Effectiveness of the CIA's Enhanced
Interrogation Techniques As Having "Saved Lives," "Thwarted Plots," and "Captured
Terrorists"

Before the CIA took custody of its first detainee, CIA attorneys
researched the limits of coercive interrogations and the legal definitions of torture. On
November 26, 2001, CIA Office of General Counsel (OGC) attorneys circulated a draft legal

memorandum entitled "Hostile Interrogations: Legal Considerations for CIA Officers."^Â®^^ The
memorandum listed interrogation techniques considered to be torture by a foreign government
and a specific nongovernmental organization, including "cold torture," "forced positions,"
"enforced physical exhaustion," "sensory deprivation," "perceptual deprivation," "social
deprivation," "threats and humiliation," "conditioning techniques," and "deprivation of
sleep."
The draft memorandum described various prohibitions on torture and the potential
use of "necessity" as a legal defense against charges of torture, stating:
"[i]t would, therefore, be a novel application of the necessity defense to avoid
prosecution of U.S. officials who tortured to obtain information that saved
many lives... A policy decision must be made with regard to U.S. use of
torture in light of our obligations under international law, with consideration
given to the circumstances and to intemational opinion on our current

campaign against terrorismâstates may be very unwilling to call the U.S. to
task for torture when it resulted in saving thousands of lives
On February 1, 2002, a CTC attorney researched the impact of the

application of the Geneva Conventions (GC) on future CIA interrogation activities.The
attorney wrote:

"If the detainee is a POW and enjoys GC coverage, then the optic becomes
how legally defensible is a particular act that probably violates the convention,
but ultimately saves lives. I believe that [a named CIA attorney!'s papers
reflecting on necessity and anticipatory selfdefense are the two most obvious
defenses available."^^^^

(U) The Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) included the "necessity defense"
in its August 1, 2002, memorandum to the White House Counsel, determining, among other
things, that "under the current circumstances, necessity or self-defense mayjustify interrogation
methods that might violate" the criminal prohibition against torture.The OLC memorandum
states:

"It appears to us that under the cun-ent circumstances the necessity defense
could be successfully maintained in response to an allegation of a Section
2340A violation. .. .Under these circumstances, a detainee may possess
Italics added. November 26, 2001, Draft of Legal Appendix, Paragraph 5, "Hostile Intenogations: Legal
Considerations for CIA Officers," at L The CIAwould later repeat bothclaims, representing to seniorofficials and
the Department of Justice that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques produced intelligence that
"saved lives," and that this intelligence was otherwise unavailable. Further, on August 1, 2002, OLC issued an
unclassified, but non-public opinion, in the form of a memorandum to White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales,
analyzing whether certain interrogation methods would violate 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2340-2340A. The memorandum

provides a similar rationalefor the necessity defense, stating, "certainjustification defenses might be available that
would potentially eliminate criminalliability. Standard criminal law defensesof necessity and self-defense could
justify intenogation methods needed to elicit information to prevent a direct and imminent threat to the United
States and its citizens." The memorandum laterconcludes: "even if an interrogation method might violate Section

2340A, necessity orself-defense coul^rovid^ustifi^ions that would eliminate any criminal liability."

information that could enable the United States to prevent attacks that

potentially could equal or surpass the September 11 attacks in their magnitude.
Clearly, any harm that might occur during an interrogation would pale to
insignificance compared to the harm avoided by preventing such an attack,
which could take hundreds or thousands of lives."^^^^

According to a report by the Department of Justice Office of
ProfessionalResponsibility (OPR), released in July 2009, Deputy Assistant Attorney General
John Yoo "acknowledged that the CIA may have indirecdy suggested the new sections [related
to Commander-in-Chief authority and possible defenses, including the necessity defense] by
asking him what would happen in a case where an interrogator went 'over the line' and
inadvertently violated the statute." Yoo also told the OPR that he drafted those relevant sections.
Another senior Department of Justice lawyer at the time, Patrick Philbin, informed the OPR that
when he told Yoo that the sections were superfluous and should be removed, Yoo responded,
"They want it in there." The CIA's former Deputy General Counsel John Rizzo told the OPR
that the CIA did not request the addition of the sections.In his response to the OPR report,
Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee stated that the "ticking time bomb" that could justify the
necessity defense was, in fact, a "real world" scenario. According to Bybee, "the OLC attorneys
working on the [August 1, 2002] Memo had been briefed on the apprehension of Jose Padilla on

May 8, 2002. Padilla was believed to have built and planted a dirty bomb."^^^^ The August 1,
2002, memorandum states that the "[i]nterrogation of captured al Qaida operatives allegedly
allowed U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies to track Padilla and to detain him upon

his entry into the United States."^Â®^^ This information was inaccurate.

With the issuance on August 1, 2002, of a second OLC

memorandum specific to Abu Zubaydah,^^'''^ the CIA initiated the use of its enhanced
inten*ogation techniques. After the CIA subjected Abu Zubaydah and other CIA detainees to the
techniques, the CIA made increasingly stronger assertions about the effectiveness of the CIA's
interrogation program, eventually asserting that the CIA interrogation program "saved lives,"^^^^
and that the use of the CIA's enhanced inten'ogation techniques was necessary, as the
intelligence obtained could not have been acquired in any other way.
Many of the representations made by the CIA about the

effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were first made in the spring of
2003 and evolved over the course of the year and into early 2004. In April 2003, CIA officers
told the CIA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) that KSM, who had been subjected to the

techniques between March [j, 2003, and March 25, 2003, was still not fully cooperative. For

example, on April 3, 2003, more than a week after the CIA had discontinued the use of its

enhanced interrogation techniques on KSM, the deputy chief of ALEC Station,

"express our surprise and concern at some of the statements attributed to the
Administration in the piece, particularly the Presidential statement on the UN

International Day in Support of Victims of Torture as well as a quote from the
Deputy White House Press Secretary ScottMcClellan that all prisoners being
held by the USG are being treated 'humanely.
While Rizzo expressed the view that the presidential statement did
not appear to contain anything "we can't live with," Rizzo conveyed to senior CIA leaders that it
"might well be appropriate for us to seekwritten reaffirmation by some seniorWhite House
official that the Agency's ongoing practices... are to continue."^^^^
Ori July 3, 2003, DCI George Tenet sent a memorandum to

National Security Advisor CondoleezzaRice seeking reaffirmation of the Administration's
support for the CIA's detention and interrogation policies and practices. The memorandum
stated that the reaffirmation was sought because:
"recent Administration responses to inquiries and resulting media reporting
about the Administration's position have created the impression that these

[interrogation] techniques are not used by U.S. personnel and are no longer
approved as a policy matter."^"^^
While the CIA was preparing to meet with the White House on the

reaffirmation of the CIA interrogation program, CIA personnel provided additional inaccurate

information about the "effectiveness" of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques to the
OIG, as well as to senior CIA leadership. These inaccurate representations described the

"thwarting" of specific plots and the capture of specific terrorists attributed to the interrogation
of CIA detainees and the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.

was interviewed again by the OIG. In this interview

asserted that KSM

"provided information that helped lead to the arrest of lyman Paris, Uzhair Paracha, Saleh al-

Marri, Majid Khan, and Ammar al-Baluchi.'Â°^^ These representations were almost entirely
maccurate.

"Simply put, detainee information has saved countless American lives inside

the US and abroad. We believe there is no doubt al-Qa'ida would have
succeeded in launching additional attacks in the US and that the information

obtained from these detainees through the use of enhanced measures was key

to interrogate and use enhanced measures in a responsible way, we will not be
able to effectively prosecute this war."^^^^

In subsequent interviews of CIA personnel, the OIG received
information that contradicted other CIA representations about the CIA's Detention and

Interrogation Program. The chief of the |||| Branch of the UBL Group at CTC described at
length how the arrests of Majid Khan and lyman Paris were um-elated to reporting from CIA

The deputy director for law enforcement for the FBI's Counterterrorism Division
told the OIG how Uzhair Paracha and FBI operational activities were ultimately responsible for

the capture of Sayf al-Rahman Paracha.The chief of targeting and special requirem^Jts for

At the same time, however, CIA personnel provided inaccurate

examples of the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques to the OIG. The
deputy chief of the Al-Qa'ida Department of CTC told the OIG that "KSM gave us Majid Khan
and Uzair Paracha."'
Deputy DCI John McLaughlin told the OIG that information from KSM

also represented that "the capture of Richard Reid was a result of modus operandi information

the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against CIA detainees. Jose Rodriguez, then CTC
director, told the CIA OIG that "the use of EITs has saved lives and prevented terrorist
operations from occurring."Deputy DCI McLaughlin told the OIG that he "believes the use
of EITs has proven critical to CIA's efforts in the war on terrorism."^DDO Pavitt stated that
the program was "invaluable to U.S. national security," that "American lives have been saved as
a result of information received from detainees," and that the CIA "has been able to obtain

information that would not have been obtained without the use of EITs."*^^Â° According to OIG
records, DCI Tenet stated he "firmly believes that the interrogation program, and specifically the
use of EITs, has saved many lives." Tenet added that the use of the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques was "extremely valuable" in obtaining "enormous amounts of critical
threat information," and that he did not believe that the information could have been gained any
other way.^^^^

described the origins of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, the detention sites that
were operational at the time of the review, and the guidance that had been provided on both

interrogation and detention. The draft also identified a number of unauthorized interrogation

techniques that had been used,^^"^ and conckided that, in a number ofcases, CIA interrogations
went "well beyond what was articulated in the written DOJ legal opinion of 1 August 2002."^^-^

executions, blowingcigaretteor cigar smoke intoa detainee's face, usingcold water to interrogate detainees, and
subjecting a detainee to a "hard takedown." In an interview conducted after Gul Rahman's death at DETENTION

SITE COBALT, Dr. DUNBAR described a "rough takedown." The interview report stated: "According to
[DUNBAR], there were approximately five CIA officers from the renditions team. Each one had a roleduring the
takedown and it was thoroughly planned and rehearsed. They opened tlie door of [a detainee] cell and rushed in
screaming and yelling for him to 'get down.' They dragged him outside, cut off his clothes and secured him with

Mylar tape. They covered his head with a hood and ranhimup anddown a long corridor adjacent to his cell. They
slapped himandpunched himseveral times. [DUNBAR] stated that although it was obvious they were not trying to
hit him as hard as theycould, a couple of times the punches were forceful. As they ran him along thecorridor, a
couple of times he fell and they dragged him through the dirt (the floor outside of the cells is dirt). [The detainee]
did acquire a numberof abrasions on his face, legs, and hands, but nothing that required medical attention."
DUNBAR stated that after "something like this is done, interrogators should speak to the prisoner to 'give diem
something to think about.'" See Memorandum for Deputy Directorof Operations, from |

The draft report repeated the inaccurate examples of the "effectiveness" of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques that had been conveyed by CIA officers to OIG personnel,but
nonetheless concluded:

"[w]ith the capture of some of the operatives for the above-mentioned plots,
it is not clear whether these plots have been thwarted or if they remain viable
or even if they were fabricated in the first place. This Review did not
uncover any evidence that these plots were imminent."

After reviewing the draft Special Review, including the OIG's

qualified conclusions about the effectiveness ofthe CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques^he
CIA's CTC began preparing a highly critical response. In preparation for that response,

|CTC Legal,

requested additional information that could be used as

evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques from CTC

personnel.
sent an email seeking "a list of specific plots that have been thwarted by
the use of detainee reporting that we acquired following the use of enhanced techniques."
noted that he would compile the information, "emphasizing that hundreds or
thousands of innocent lives have been saved as a result of our use of those techniques...

In

a separate email,
emphasized that it was "critical" that the information"establish
direct links between the application of the enhanced interrogation techniques and the production
of intelligence that directly enabled the saving of innocentlives," that the intelligence obtained
after the use of die CIA's enlianced inten'ogation techniques be "significantly different in nature
from the intelligence acquired before the use of the enhanced techniques," and that the
information be "absolutely ironclad" and "demonstrably supported by cable citations, analytical

pieces, or what have you."^^^^

further noted that "[w]e can expect to need to

present these data to appropriately cleared personnel at the IG and on the Hill, to the Attorney
General, and quite possibly to the President at some point, and they must be absolutely
verifiable." He concluded, "[i]t is not an exaggeration to say that the future of the program, and

the consequent saving of innocent lives, may depend substantially upon the input you
provide.""^^

The SpecialReview draft stated that KSM"providedinformation that helped lead to the arrests" of Sayf alRahman Paracha, Uzhair Paracha, Saleh al-Marri, and Majid Khan, and that KSM's information "led to the

investigation and prosecution" of lyman Paris. The draft Special Review also stated that information from Abu

Zubaydah "helped lead to the identification" ofJose PadillaandBii^^ Muhammad. Finally, the draft included the
"plots" described by Deputy Chief of ALEC Station
during her July 16, 2003, interview. Most
of the inaccurate representations wouldremain in the final version of the Special Review completedin May 2004.

techniques were b a s e d . e m a i l stated that "Khalid Shaykh Muhammad's
information alone has saved at least several hundred, possibly thousands, of lives." She then
wrote that KSM "identified" lyman Paris, "who is now serving time in the US for his support to
al-Qa'ida," and "identified a photograph" of Saleh al-Marri, "whom the FBI suspected of some
involvement with al-Qa'ida, but against whom we had no concrete information," adding that al-

Marri "is now being held on a material witness warrant." IH^H's email stated that KSM
"provided information" on Majid Khan, who "is now in custody," "identified a mechanism for
al-Qa'ida to smuggle explosives into the US," and "identified" Jaffar al-Tayyar.^'^^
email also represented that "[a]fter the use of enhanced [interrogation techniques], [Abu
Zubaydah] grew into what is now our most cooperative detainee," and that Abu Zubaydah's
information "produced concrete results that helped saved lives."These representations were
almost entirely inaccurate.As she had in an interview with the OIG,

former chief of the Abu Zubaydah Task Force, refuted this view, writing in an email that Abu
Zubaydah "never really gave 'this is the plot' type of information," that Abu Zubaydah discussed
Jose Padilla prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, and that "he never

really gave us actionable intel to get them.""^"^ Separately, Deputy Chiefof ALEC Station

Station to CTC Legal related to

al-Nashiri,'^^^ and Hambali.^^^^

On February 27, 2004, DDO Pavitt submitted his formal response
to the OIG draft Special Review in the form of a memorandum to the inspector general. Pavitt

urged the CIA OIG not to "shy away from the conclusion that our efforts have thwarted attacks
and saved lives," and to "make it clear as well that the EITs (including the waterboard) have

been indispensable to our successes."^Pavitt's memorandum included an attachment
describing the "Successes of CIA's CounterteirorismDetention and Interrogation Activities,"
and why the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were necessary. The attachment stated:
"Information we received from detained terrorists as a result of the lawful use

of enhanced interrogation techniques ('EITs') has almost certainly saved
countless American lives inside the United States and abroad. The evidence

points clearly to the fact that without the use of such techniques, we and our

had told the CIA about Jose Padilla and liis partner prior to Abu Zubaydah providing any information on the pair,

jfHHmillstated, "[i]n essence, CTC got lucky." Tliis infonnation was not included intlie draft orfinal OIG
Special Review.

The information forwarded by

was related to tlie Heathrow Aiqiort plotting and stated that "[o]nly

after enhanced measures" did KSM "admit that the sketch of a beam labeled Canary Wharf in his notebook was in

fact an illustration that KSM the engineer drew himself to show another AQ operative tliat tlie beams in the Wharflike tliose in the World Trade Center - would likely melt and collapse the building, killing all inside." The email
also stated that KSM "identified the leading operatives involved in both the UK and Saudi cells that would support
the operation." These representations were inaccurate. See the section of this summary and Volume 11 on the
Thwarting of the Heatlirow Airport and Canary Wharf Plotting, and the KSM detainee review in Volume III.
'â¢36 Tlie information forwarded by
stated that, "subsequent to the application of enhanced measures," the
CIA "learned more in-depthdetails" about operational planning, "to includeongoingoperations against botli the US
and Saudi interests in Saudi Arabia." This representation omitted key informationprovided by al-Nashiri in foreign
government custody and prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. See the 'Abd al-Rahimal-

Nashiri detainee review in Volume lU^^^
The information forwarded by
stated that, "after tlie use of enhanced measures [Hambali] provided
information that led to the wrap-up of an al-Qa'ida cell in Kar achi, some of whose members were destined to be the

T^he attachment to Pavitt's memorandum repeated much of the

inaccurate information contained in Deputy Chief of ALEC Station
about KSM and Abu Zubaydah, as well as the additional information ALEC Station personnel
provided on KSM, al-Nashiri, and Hambali. In Pavitt's memorandum, every intelligence success
claim was preceded with some version of the phrase, "as a result of the lawful use of EITs."'''^^
Inaccurate information provided to the OIG during interviews and in the Pavitt memorandum

was included in the final version of the OIG's Special Review.^The relevant portion of the
Special Review, including much of the inaccurate information, has been declassified.'''^^

As ^^^HUcTC Legal

anticipated

February 10, 2004, email, much of the information provided to the inspector general on the
"effectiveness" of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was later provided to
policymakers and the Department of Justice as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques.

In late 2004, as the National Security Council was considering
"endgame" options for CIA detainees, the CIA proposed a public relations campaign that would
include disclosures about the "effectiveness" of the CIA program. CIA talking points prepared
in December 2004 for the DCI to use with National Security Council principals stated that "[ijf
done cleverly, selected disclosure of intelligence results could heighten the anxiety of terrorists at
large about the sophistication of USG methods and underscore the seriousness of American

commitment to prosecute aggressively the War on Terrorism.""'^ The following month, the

A review of CIA records found that almost all of the information in the Pavitt memorandum was inaccurate and

unsupported by CIA inten:ogation and intelligence records. The CIA's June 2013 Response states that CIA officers
"generally provided accurate information [to the Inspector General] on the operation and effectiveness of the
program," and that "with rare exceptions, [CIA officers] provided accurate assessments to the OIG."
The CIA Inspector General Special Review, "Counterterrorism Detention and Interrogation Program," was

CIA proposed that the public information campaign include details on the "intelligence gained

and lives saved in HVD inten-ogations."^''^^ There was no immediate decision by the National
Security Council about an "endgame" for CIA detainees or the proposed public information
campaign.

In early April 2005,
chief of ALEC Station,
asked that information on the success of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program be
compiled in anticipation of interviews of CIA personnel by Tom Brokaw of NBC News. The
first draft included effectiveness claims relating to the "Second Wave" plotting, the Heathrow

Airport plotting, the Karachi plotting, and the identification of a second shoebomber.^A
subsequent draft sought to limit the information provided to what was already in the public

record and included assertions about Issa al-Hindi, lyman Paris, and Sajid Badat.^^"^^ That day.
Deputy Director of CTC Philip Mudd told
that "we either get out and sell, or we get
hammered, which has implications beyond the media. [CJongress reads it, cuts our authorities,
messes up our budget."The following day, the draft was cleared for release to the media.

identity." It added tliat "KSM's reporting was the impetus for an intense investigation, culminating in Issa's
identification and arrest." The draft also included two examples that had not been in official public documents, but
had been described in press stories. The first was that "KSM led U.S. investigators to an Ohio tnick driver named

lyman Paris." Tlie second was that "KSM's confessionswereals^nstrumental in determining the identity ofSaajid

On April 20, 2005, the same examples were circulated as part of an
anticipated official public campaign to promote the "effectiveness" of the still-classified CIA

program.^In response.
|CTC Legal,
|, expressed concern that
"the examples cited, while true, and perhaps as far as we can go, are not nearly the most striking
examples of lives saved." Referencing KSM's reporting on lyman Paris,
noted that
"we risk making ourselves look silly if the best we can do is the Brooklyn Bridge - perhaps we
should omit specific examples rather than 'danm ourselves with faint praise.'"
who offered the Heathrow Airport plot as an example, made the following suggestion: "Can
[Office of Public Affairs] be more strongly declarative - 'while we can't provide details' (or

maybe we can) 'the program has produce^nteUigence that has directly saved lOO's/lOOO's of

American and other innocent lives'?"
then attached claims originally compiled in
February 2004 for the purpose of responding to the draft OIG Special Review which, he wrote,
described "some of the actionable intelligence acquired as a result of the Program and the lawful
use of such techniques."^*''' The examples were inaccurate.*
On June 24, 2005, Dateline NBC aired a program, accompanied by
several online articles, which quoted CIA Director Goss and Deputy Director of CTC Mudd, as
well as anonymous "top American intelligence officials." Among other claims, NBC reported
that the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh "le[d] ultimately" to the captures of KSM and Khallad bin
Attash.^*^^ This information was inaccurate.

At the end of 2005, congressional concerns about the treatment of
detainees again spurred interest at the CIA for public disclosures on the "effectiveness" of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. Specifically, congressional action on the Detainee
Treatment Act (the "McCain amendment") prompted a CIA attorney working at the Office of the
Director of National Intelligence to express concern that legislative support was needed for the
CIA to continue to use its enhanced interrogation techniques, and that a public information
campaign would be required to garner that support. The CIA attorney described the "striking"
similarities between the public debate surrounding the McCain amendment and the situation in
Israel in 1999, in which the Israeli Supreme Court had "ruled that several... techniques were
possibly permissible, but require some form of legislative sanction," and that the Israeli

government "ultimately got limited legislative authority for a few specific techniques."^

The

CIA attorney then wrote:

"Once this became a political reality here, it became incumbent on the
Administration to publicly put forth some facts, if it wanted to preserve these
powers. Yet, to date, the Administration has refused to put forth any specific
examples of significant intelligence it adduced as a result of using any
technique that could not reasonably be construed as cruel, inhuman or
degrading. Not even any historical stuff from three or four years ago. What
conclusions are to be drawn from the utter failure to offer a specific

justification: That no such proof exists? That the Administration does not
recognize the legitimacy of the political process on this issue? Or, that need to
reserve the right to use these techniques really is not important enough to

justify the compromise of even historical intelligence?"^
described in more detail in the full Committee Study, the

Administration sought legislative support to continue the CIA's Detention and Interrogation
Program, and chose to do so by publicly disclosing the program in a 2006 speech by President
Bush. The speech, which was based on CIA-provided information and vetted by the CIA,
included numerous inaccurate representations about the CIA program and the effectiveness of
the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques. The CIA's vetting of the speech is detailed in CIA
"validation" documents, which include CIA concurrence and citations to records to support

specific passages of the speech. For example, the CIA "Validation of Remarks" document
includes the following:

'''...questioning the detainees in this program has given us information that
has saved innocent lives by helping us to stop new attacks - here in the United
States and across the world.'

CIA concurs with this assessment. Information from detainees prevented -

among others - the West Coast airliner plot, a plot to blow up an apartment
The CIA attorney also described the Israeli precedent with regard to the "necessity defense" that had been
invoked by CIA attorneys and the Department of Justice in 2001 and 2002. Tlie CIA attorney wrote that the Israeli
Supreme Court "also specifically considered the 'ticking time bomb' scenario and said tiiat enhanced techniques
could not be pre-approved for such situations, but that if worse came to worse, an officer who engaged in such
activities could assert a common-law necessity defense, if he were ever prosecuted." {See email from:

Multiple iterations ofthe CIA "validation" documents reflect

changes to the speech as it was being prepared. One week before the scheduled speech, a
passage in the draft speech made inaccurateclaims about the role played by Abu Zubaydah in the
capaire of Ramzi bin al-Shibh and the role of Abu Zubaydah and Ramzi bin al-Shibh in the
capture of KSM, but did not explicitly connect these claims to the use of the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques. In an August 31, 2006, email exchange, CIA officers proposed the
following language for the speech:

"That same year, information from Zubaydah led the CIA to the trail of one of
KSM's accomplices, Ramzi bin al Shibh. Information from Zubaydah together
with information from Shibh gave the CIA insight into al-Qa'ida's 9/11 attack

planning and th^mportanc^fKSM With the knowledge that KSM was the
'mastermind,' |||||||m|H||||||| Pakistani partners planned and mounted an
operation that resulted in his eventual capture and detention."

The August 31, 2006, email exchange included citations to CIA

cables to support the proposed passage; however, neither the cables, nor any other CIA records,
support the assertions.^

inaccurate.

The cited cables describe Abu Zubaydah's June 2002 description of a meeting with Ramzi bin al-Shibh

(acquired prior to the use ofthe CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against Abu Zubaydah), and Abu

Zubaydah's August 200^eportin^i^ussing the same meeting (after the use ofthe techniques). (See CIA
(I01514Z JUN 02);
August 2002).) Neither cableâor any other CIA recordâindicates a
connection between Abu Zubaydah's reporting on his meeting with bin al-Shibh and bin al-Shibh's capture. The
cited cables also do not include information, which was available to the CIA prior to the captureof Abu Zubaydali,
highlighting KSM's "importance." The citedcabledescribes Abu Zubaydah's April 2002 reporting, prior to the use

ofthe CIA's enhance^nteiToe^ techniques, identifying KSM as "Mukhtar" and the "mastermind" ofthe 9/11
attacks. (See H||||^^^H|^|(13 April 2002).) The citations did not include cables referencing infonnation
available to the CIA about KSM that was obtained prior to the capture of Abu Zubaydah, including information on
KSM's alias "Mukhtai'" and KSM's role in tlie September 11, 2001, attacks, as is detailed elsewhere in this

summary. The cables also did not supportthe claim that information provided by Abu Zubaydahor Ramzi bin alShibh led to the capture of KSM. One cited cable related to the identification by Ramzi bin al-Shibh, while bin al-

Within a few days, the passage in the draft speech relating to the
captures of Ramzi bin al-Shibh and KSM was modified to connect the use of the CIA's enhanced
inteiTogation techniques against Abu Zubaydah to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh. The
updated draft now credited information from Abu Zubaydah and Ramzi bin al-Shibh with
"help[ing] in the planning and execution of the operation that captured Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed." The updated draft speech stated:

"Zubaydah [zoo-BAY-da] was questioned using these [interrogation]
procedures, and he soon began to provide information on key al-Qaida
operatives - including information that helped us find and capture more of
those responsible for the attacks of Nine-Eleven. For example, Zubaydah
[zoo-BAY-da] identified one of KSM's accomplices in the Nine-Eleven
attacks - a terrorist named Ramzi bin al Shibh [SHEEB]. The information

Zubaydah [zoo-BAY-da] provided helped lead to the capture of bin al Shibh.
And together these two terrorists provided information that helped in the
planning and execution of the operation that captured Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed."^

An updated CIA "validation" document concurring with the
proposed passage provided a modified list of CIA cables as "sources" to support the passage.
Cable citations to Abu Zubaydah's reporting prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques were removed.Like the previous version, the CIA's updated "validation"
document did not cite to any cables demonstrating that information from Abu Zubaydah "helped

lead to the capture of [Ramzi] bin al-Shibh."^

Similarly, none of the cables cited to support

the passage indicated that information from Abu Zubaydah and Ramzi bin al-Shibh (who was in
foreign government custody when he provided the information cited by the CIA) "helped in the

described KSM's capture, stating that it was "based on locational information" provided by the asset. {See
41351
) Neither of the two cables cited to support the claim made any
reference to Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, or any other detainee in CIA or foreign government custody. The

planning and execution of the operation thatcaptured [KSM]."^'^^ As described elsewhere in
this summary, there are no CIA records to support these claims.
The CIA documents validating the president's speech addressed
other passages that were Hkewise unsupported by the CIA's cited cables. For example, the
speech included an inaccurate claim regarding KSM that had been part of the CIA's
representations on the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques since 2003.
The speech stated:

"Once in our custody, KSM was questioned by the CIA using these
procedures, and he soon provided information that helped us stop another
planned attack on the United States. During questioning, KSM told us about
another al Qaeda operative he knew was in CIA custody - a terrorist named
Majid Khan. KSM revealed that [Majid] Khan had been told to deliver
$50,000 to individuals working for a suspected terrorist leader named Hambah,
the leader of al Qaeda's Southeast Asian affiliate known as 'J-I.' CIA officers

confronted Khan with this information. Khan confirmed that the money had
been delivered to an operative named Zubair, and provided both a physical
description and contact number for this operative. Based on that information,
Zubair was captured in June of 2003, and he soon provided information that

helped lead to the capture of Hambali."' ^^^
support for this passage, the CIA cited a June 2003 cable

describing a CIA interrogation of Majid Khan in which Majid Khan discussed Zubair.^The
CIA "validation" document did not include cable citations from March 2003 that would have

revealed that Majid Khan provided this inforaiation while in foreign government custody, prior

to the reporting from KSM.^'^"^

The CIA document included a previousl^itec^^le relatin^^hecapture^ KSM that made no mention of

reporting from CIA detainees. (^See

41351 ri^HIH|||||Hi ) '^he CIA document also

included the previously cited cable describing bin al-Shibh's identification of "Ammar." As described in the section
of this summary, as well as in Volume II, on the Capture of KSM, KSM was not captured as a result of information

relate^o Ammar al-Baluchi. (The document cited the cable as

20700, as noted, the actual cite was

20790.) The CIA cable also cited an analytical product whose relevance was limited to the connection

between KSM and al-Aziz (Ammar al-Baluchi). (See DI SerialFlierCTC 2002-30086CH: CIA analytic report,
"Threat Threads: Recent Advances in Understanding 11 September.") Finally, the document included a cable that
was unrelated to the content of the speech.

On September 6, 2006, President Bush delivered the speech based
on the CIA-vetted information.On September 8, 2006, the chief of the

Department in CTC,
participated in the CIA's validation of the
speech, distributed the "final validation document" for possible updates or changes. In an email,

m m urged the recipients to "[pjlease look very carefully, as this is going to be a very
important document."

On September 11, 2006, a CIA officer responded, questioning the

passage in the speech related to the capture of KSM, as well as the relevance of the CIA cables
cited in the validation document to support the passage. The CIA officer questioned whether a
CIA cable describing Ramzi bin al-Shibh's identification of "Ammar" supported the claim that
bin al-Shibh's reporting helped lead to the capture of KSM. The officer wrote:

"I presume the information in this cable that supports the statement is Ramzi's
admission regarding Ammar?? Did that actually help lead us to KSM?? not
sure who did this section, but we may want to double-check this and provide
additional cables on how this actually 'assisted us'. This also seems to be a
point critics in the press seem to be picking on, I will do some digging on my
own as well."^'^^
There are no CIA records to indicate that the CIA officer's

comments about the inadequate sourcing were further addressed. As described in this summary,
and in more detail in Volume H, there are no CIA records to support the passage in the speech
related to the capture of KSM.
After the speech, press accounts challenging aspects of the speech

became the subject ofinternal discussion amon^om^I^officers. On September 7, 2006, the

chief of the KIIHH Department in CTC,

NY Times has posted a story predictably poking holes in the President's speech." Defending the
passage in the specch asserting that, after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.

On April 29, 2009, Marc Thiessen, the speechwriter responsible for President Bush's September 6, 2006,
speech, wrote: "This was the most carefully vetted speech in presidential history - reviewed by all the key players
from the individuals who ran the program all the way up to the director of national intelligence, who personally
attested to the accuracy of the speech in a memo to tlie president. And just last week on Fox News, former CIA
Director Michael Hayden said he went back and checked with the agency as to the accuracy of that speech and
reported: *We stand by our story.'" See Maic Thiessen, "The West Coast Plot: An 'Inconvenient Truth,"' The

"...we knew Ramzi bin al-Shibh was involved in 9/11 before AZ was captured;
however, AZ gave us information on his recent activities thatâwhen added

into other informationâhelped us track him. Again, on this point, we were
very careful and the speech is accurate in what it says about bin al-Shibh."^

"identified" Ramzi bin al-Shibh.^

The New York Times article also challenged the representation in
the speech that Abu Zubaydah "disclosed" that KSM was the "mastermind behind the 9/11

attacks and used the alias 'Mukhtar,'" and that "[t]his was a vital picce of the puzzle that helped
our intelligence community pursue KSM." As the New York Times article noted, the 9/11

Commissior^iad pointed to acable from August 2001 that identified KSM as "Mukhtar." In her
email,
acknowledged the August 2001 report identifying KSM as "Mukhtar" and
provided additional information on the drafting of the speech:

"[0]n 28 August, 2001, in fact, [CIA's] HHHI [database] does show a report
from [a source] stating that Mohammad Rahim's brother Zadran told him that

KSM was now being called 'Mukhtar.' Moreover, we were suspicious that
KSM might have been behind 9/11 as early as 12 Sept 2001, and we had some
reporting indicating he was the mastermind. We explained this latter fact to
the White House, although the 28 August report escaped our notice."

prevent a number of attacks, including plotsto fly passenger airplanes intothe Library Tower in Los Angeles and

inaccurate representations in the speech have been repeated in numerous articles, books, and
broadcasts. The speech was also relied upon by the OLC in its July 20, 2007, memorandum on

the legality of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, specifically to support the premise
that the use of the techniques was effective in "producing substantialquantities of otherwise
unavailable intelligence."'

D. CIA Representations About theEffectiveness of Its Enhanced Interrogation Techniques
Against Specific CIA Detainees

While the CIA made numerous general representations about the

effectiveness of its enhanced interrogation techniques, CIA representations on specific detainees
focused almost exclusively on two CIA detainees, Abu Zubaydah, detained on March 28, 2002,
and KSM, detained on March 1, 2003.''^Â®
I. Abu Zubaydah

As described in greater detail in the full Committee Study, the CIA
provided significant information to policymakers and the Department of Justice on the CIA's
decision to use the newly developed CIA^'enhanced interrogation techniques" on Abu Zubaydcih
and the effects of doing so. These representations were provided by the CIA to the CIA OIG,''^'

enhancedintenogation techniques with regard to the SecondWave, Heathrow, Djibouti and Karachi plots were
inaccurate.

The OLC memorandum, along withother OLC memoranda relying on inaccurate CIA representations, has been
declassified, as has the May 2004OIGSpecial Review containing inaccurate information provided by CIA officers.

on al-Qa'ida activities, plans, capabilities, and relationships, in addition to information on its

leadership structure, including personalities, decision-making processes, training, and tactics.

See ODNI September2006 Unclassified Public Release: "During initial interrogation, AbuZubaydah gave some
information that he probably viewed as nominal. Some was important, however, including that Khalid Shaykh
Mohammad (KSM) was the 9/11 mastermind and used the moniker 'Mukhtar.' This identification allowed us to

comb previously collected intelligence for both names, opening up new leads to this terrorist plotterâleads that
eventually resulted in his capture. It was clear to his interrogators that Abu Zubaydah possessed a great deal of
information about al-Qa'ida; however, he soon stopped all cooperation. Overthe ensuing montlis, the CIA designed
a new interrogation program that would be safe, effective, and legal." Seealso Presidential Speechon September 6,

information that could save innocent lives. But he stopped talking... And so, the CIA used an alternative set of

on the next attack in the United Statesâand operatives in the United Statesâprovided the basis

for CIA representations that Abu Zubaydah was "uncooperative," as well as for the CIA's
determination that Abu Zubaydah required the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques to become "compliant" and reveal the information that CIA Headquarters believed he
was withholding. The CIA further stated that Abu Zubaydah could stop the application of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, like the waterboard, by providing the names of

operatives in the United States or information to stop the next attack.^At no point during or
after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques did Abu Zubaydah provide this type
of information.

representation that Abu Zubaydah's interrogation team
believed the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques would result in new information
on operatives in the United States and teiTorist plotting is also incongruent with CIA records.
While Abu Zubaydah was in isolation in July 2002, CIA Headquarters informed the Department
of Justice and White House officials that Abu Zubaydah's interrogation team believed Abu

Zubaydah possessed information on terrorist threats to, and al-Qa'ida operatives in, the United
States.The CIA officials further represented that the interrogation team had concluded that
the use of more aggressive methods "is required to persuade Abu Zubaydah to provide the
critical information needed to safeguard the lives of innumerable innocent men, women, and
children within the United States and abroad," and warned "countless more Americans may die

unless wecan persuade AZ to tell us what he knows."^-Â®^ However, according to CIA cables, the
interrogation team at the detention site had not determined that the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques were required for Abu Zubaydah to provide such threat information. Rather, the
interrogation team wrote "[o]ur assumption is the objective of this operation is to achieve a high
degree of confidence that [Abu Zubaydah] is not holding back actionable information concerning

threats to the United States beyond that which [Abu Zubaydah] has already provided."^^^^
The CIA representation that the use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah was effective in producing critical threat information
See

10586 (041559Z AUG 02), which states: "In trutli, [Zubaydah] can halt the proceedings at any

time by providing truthful revelations on the threat which may save countless lives."
See Abu Zubaydah detainee review in Volume III.
'200 As detailed in DIRECTOR
(031357Z AUG 02). The CIA further represented: (1) that the enhanced

interrogation phase of Abu Zubaydah's interrogation would likely last "no more than several days but could last up
to thirty days," (2) "that tlie use of the [enhanced interrogation techniques] would be on an as-needed basis and that
not all of these techniques will necessaiily be used," (3) tliat the CIA expected "these techniques to be used in some
sort of escalating fashion, culminating with the waterboard, though not necessarilyending with this technique," (4)
"that although some of these techniques may be used more tiian once, that repetition will not be substantial because
the techniques generally lose their effectiveness after several repetitions," and (5) "that steps will be taken to ensure
tliat [Abu Zubaydah's] injury is not in any way exacerbated by the use of these methods." See the Abu Zubaydah
detainee review for detailed information for how these statements proved almost entirely inaccurate. See also

Abu Zubaydah did not provide the information for which the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques werejustified and approvedâinformation on the next attack and operatives in the
United States.According to CIA records, Abu Zubaydah provided information on "al-Qa'ida
activities, plans, capabilities, and relationships," in addition to information on "its leadership
structure, including personalities, decision-making processes, training, and tactics."'^Â®"^ This type
of information was provided by Abu Zubaydah prior to, during, and after the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques.At no point during or after the use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques did Abu Zubaydah provide information on al-Qa'ida cells in the United
States or operational plans for terrorist attacks against the United States.Further, a
quantitative review of Abu Zubaydah's intelligence reporting indicates that more intelligence
reports were disseminated from Abu Zubaydah's first two months of interrogation, before the use
of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and when FBI special agents were directly
participating, than were derived during the next two-month phase of interrogations, which
included the non-stop use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques 24 hours a day for 17

days.'^^^ Nonetheless, on August 30, 2002, the CIA informed the National Security Council that

See Abu Zubaydah detainee review in Volume III.

Abu Zubaydah was taken intoCIAcustody on March
2002, and was shortly thereafter hospitalized until
April 15, 2002. Abu Zubaydah returned to DETENTION SITEGREEN on April 15,2002. During the months of
April and May 2002, which included a period during which Abu Zubaydah was on lifesupport andunable to speak
(Abu Zubaydah communicated primarily withFBI special agents in writing), Abu Zubaydah's interrogations
resulted in 95 intelligence reports. In February 2008, the CIAidentified the "key intelligence andreporting derived"
from Abu Zubaydah. The three items identified bytheCIA were all acquired in April andMay of 2002 by FBI

interrogators. Abu Zubaydah was placed in isolation from June 18, 2002, to August 4, 2002, without being asked
any questions. After 47 days in isolation, the CIA reinstituted contact widi Abu Zubaydah at approximately 11:50
AMon August 4,2002, when CIApersonnel entered the cell, shackled and hooded Abu Zubaydah, and removed his
towel, leaving Abu Zubaydali naked. Without asking any questions, CIA personnel made a collar around his neck

with a towel and used thecollar "toslam him against a concrete wall." Multiple enhanced inteiTogation techniques
were used non-stop until 6:30PM, when Abu Zubaydah was strapped to the waterboard and subjected to the
waterboard technique "numerous times" between 6:45 PM and 8:52 PM. The"aggressive phase of interrogation"

using theCIA's enhanced interrogation techniques continued for20days. {See Abu Zubaydah treatment cluonology
in Volume III.) During the months of August and September 2002, Abu Zubaydah's reporting resulted in 91
intelligence reports, fourfewer than thefirst twomonths of his CIAdetention. {See Abu Zubaydah detainee review
in VolumeIII.) Specifically, for infonnation on AbuZubaydah's initial walling, see CIA email dated March28,
2007, at 04:42 PM, withthe subject line, "Subject detainee allegation - per our telcon of today," which states that
Abu Zubaydah claims "a collar was used to slam him against a concrete wall." The CIA officer wrote, "While we

do not have a record that this occurred, one interrogator at thesite at thetime confinned that this did indeed happen.
For the record, a plywood 'wall' was immediately constructed at tlie site after the walling on the concretewall."

the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were effective and "producing meaningful
results."'^^^ Shortly thereafter, however, in October 2002, CIArecords indicate that President
Bush was informed in a Presidential Daily Brief (PDB) that "Abu Zubaydah resisted providing
useful information until becoming more cooperative in early August, probably in the hope of

improving his living conditions." The PDB made no reference to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques.Subsequently, the CIA represented to other senior policymakers
and the Department of Justice that the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were
successfully used to elicit critical information from Abu Zubaydah.For example, in a March
2, 2005, CIA memorandum to the Department of Justice, the CIA represented that information
obtained from Abu Zubaydah on the "Dirty Bomb Plot" and Jose Padilla was acquired only
''after applying [enhanced] inteiTogation techniques."This CIA representation was repeated
in numerous CIA communications with policymakers and the Department of Justice.The

information provided by the CIA was inaccurate. On the evening of April 20, 2002, prior to the
Briefing on RDIProgram" agenda, CIAdocument "ElTs andEffectiveness," withassociated documents, "Key

NSC Legal Adviser, 30 August 2002; date: September 3, 2002; ALEC |m^|, 052227Z SEP 02.) According to
I's email documenting themeeting, he "noted that we had employed thewalling techniques,
confinement box, waterboard, along with some of the other methods which also had been approved by the Attorney
General,"and "reportedthat while the experts at the site and at Headquarters were still assessing the product of the
recent sessions, it did appeal" that the current phase was producing meaningful results." {See email from: John
Rizzo; to: John Moseman; subject: Meeting with NSC Legal Adviser, 30 August 2002; date: September3, 2002.)

The email did not provide any additional detail on what was described to Bellinger with respect to either the use of
the techniques or the "results" of the interrogation. It is unclear from CIArecords whether the CIA ever informed
the NSC legal adviseror anyoneelse at the NSC or the Department of Justice that Abu Zubaydah failed to provide
information about future attacks against the UnitedStates or operatives taskedto commit attacks in the U.S., during
or after tlie use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.

ALEC ilil (181439Z OCT 02)

These representations were eventually included in the President's September 6, 2006, speech, in which the
President stated: "We knew that Zubaydah had more information that could save innocent lives, but he stopped
talking... so tlie CIA used an alternative set of procedures... Zubaydah was questioned using these procedures, and
soon he began to provideinformation on key al Qaedaoperatives, including information that helped us find and

capture more of those responsible fortlie attacks onSeptember the 11"'." Tliese representations were also made to
the Committee. On September6, 2006, DirectorHaydentestified that, "faced with the techniques and with the
prospects of whathe did notknow was coming, Abu Zubaydah decided thathe had earned tlie burden as far as

As described in more detail in the full Committee Study, the CIA
provided significant inaccurate information to policymakers on the effectiveness of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques in the interrogation of KSM. These representations were

10091 (210959Z APR 02). Despite requests by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the
CIA has never conected the record on this assertion. On September8, 2008, the Committee submitted Questions for
the Record(QFRs) to the CIA from a hearing on the legalopinions issuedby the Department of Justice's Officeof

Legal Counsel on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. Because of time constraints, theCIA agreed "to
take backseveral questions from Members that [the CIA was] unable to answer at thehearing." On the topic of the
effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, the Committee asked"Why was this information
[related to Padilla], which was not obtained through the use of EITs, included in the 'Effectiveness Memo?"' CIA

records provided for thi^jevi^ contain coinplete^respoi^s to tliese Questions for the Record. Tlie CIA's answer

to this question was:

Legal

simply inadvertently reporte^iis wrong. Abu

Zubaydah provided information on Jose Padilla while being interrogated by the FBI (HIHl 10091)." The
Committee never received this response, despite numerous requests. Instead, the CIA responded with a letter dated
October 17, 2008, stating that the "CIAhas responded to numerous written requests for information from SSCI on
this topic [the CIA's Detention andInterrogation Program]," and that"[w]e are available to provide additional
briefings on this issue to Members as necessary." In a letterto CIA Director Michael Hayden, Chairman
Rockefeller wrote, "[tjhe CIA's refusal to respond to hearing Questions for the Record is unprecedented and is
simply unacceptable." Senator Feinstein wrote a separate letterto CIA Director Michael Hayden stating, "I want
you to know that I found the October 17, 2008 reply...appalling." The CIA did not respond. (See: (1) Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence Questions for theRecord submitted to CIA Director Michael Hayden on September 8,
2008, with a request for a response by October 10,2008 (DTS #2008-3522); (2) CIA document prepared in

These representations are not supported by internal CIA records.

While the CIA represented to multiple parties that KSM provided
little threat information or actionable intelligence prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques, CIA records indicate that KSM was subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques within "a few minutes" of first being questioned by CIA
interrogators.This material fact was omitted from CIA representations.
The CIA represented that the CIA overcame KSM's resistance to

interrogation by using the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.CIA records do not
support this statement. To the contrary, there are multiple CIA records describing the
ineffectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques in gaining KSM's cooperation.
On March 26, 2003, the day after the CIA last used its enhanced interrogation techniques on
KSM, KSM was described as likely lying and engaged in an effort "to renew a possible
resistance stance.On April 2, 2003, the Interagency Intelligence Committee on Terrorism
(IICT) produced an assessment of KSM's intelligence entitled, "Precious Truths, Surrounded by
a Bodyguard of Lies." The assessment concluded that KSM was withholding information or
lying about terrorist plots and operatives targeting the United States.'--^ During and after the use
of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, the CIA repeatedly expressed concern that KSM
was lying and withholding informationin the context of CBRN (Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, and Nuclear) programs,plotting against U.S. interests in Karachi, Pakistan,
plotting against Heathrow Airport,^^^^ Abu Issa al-Britani,^^^' as well as the "Second Wave"
plotting against the "tallest building in California," which prompted the CIA's ALEC Station to
note in a cable dated April 22, 2003, that it "remain[e]d concerned that KSM's progression
towards full debriefing status is not yet apparent where it counts most, in relation to threats to US
interests, especially inside CONUS."^^^^

representation is not supported by CIA records. Numerous CIA personnel, including members
of KSM's interrogation team, expressed their belief that the waterboard interrogation technique

inaccurate information, much of which he would later acknowledge was fabricated and recant.
Specifically, KSM's fabrications andrecantations covered his activities immediately before his
capture,the identity of an individual whom he described as the protector of his children,^-"^
plotting against a U.S. aircraft carrier, a meeting with Abu Faraj al-Libi, and the location of

Tayyar to Heathrow Airport plotting'^"^^ and to Majid Khan's plotting,and producing what
CIA officials described as an "elaborate tale" linking al-Tayyar to an assassination plot against
former President Jimmy Carter.KSM later explained that "he had been forced to lie" about
al-Tayyar due to the pressure from CIA interrogators.KSM recanted other information about
the Heathrow Airport plotting, including information regarding the targeting,additional
operatives, and the tasking of prospective pilots to study at flight schools.KSM provided
significant information on Abu Issa al-Britani (Dhiren Barot) that he would later recant,

including linking Abu Issa al-Britani to Jaffaral-Tayyar and to the Heathrow Airport plot.'^''^
Under direct threat of additional waterboarding,'^^"^ KSM told CIA interrogators that he had sent
Abu Issa al-Britani to Montana to recruit African-American Muslim converts.In June 2003,

would later recant.^-^^ On May 3, 2003, CIA officers recommended revisiting the information
KSM had provided "during earlier stages of his interrogation process," noting that "he has told us
that he said some things during this phase to get the enhanced measures to stop, therefore some
of this information may be suspect."

The CIA also repeatedly referred to a comment made by KSM
while he was still in Pakistani custody as indicating that KSM had information on an imminent

attack. In reports to the inspector general,the national security advisor,^and the
Department of Justice,^^^^ among others, the CIA represented that:
"When asked about future attacks planned against the United States, he coldly
replied 'Soon, you will know.' In fact, soon we did know - after we initiated
enhanced measures."^-^^

Contrary to CIA representations, CIA records indicate that KSM's comment was interpreted by
CIA officers with KSM at the time as meaning that KSM was seeking to use his future
cooperation as a "bargaining chip" with more senior CIA officers.
Finally, the CIA attributed to KSM, along with Abu Zubaydah, the
statement that "the general US population was 'weak,' lacked resilience, and would be unable to

'do what was necessary' to prevent the teiTorists from succeeding in their goals."^-^-^ There are
no CIA operational or interrogation records to support the representation that KSM or Abu
Zubaydah made these statements.

E. CIA Effectiveness Claims Regarding a "High Volume of Critical Intelligence"
The CIA represented that the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques resulted in the collection of "a high volume of critical intelligence'-^^ on al-

Qa'ida."'^^^ The Committee evaluated the "high volume" ofintelligence collected by compiling
the total number of sole source and multi-source disseminated intelligence reports from the 119
known CIA detainees.

The CIA informed the Committee that its interrogation program
was successful in developing intelligence and suggested that all CIA detainees produced
disseminated intelligence reporting. For example, in September 2006, CIA Director Michael
Hayden provided the following testimony to the Committee:
Senator Bayh: "I was impressed by your statement about how effective the
[CIA's enhanced interrogation] techniques have been in eliciting important
information to the country, at one point up to 50 percent of our information
about al-Qa'ida. I think you said 9000 different intelligence reports?"
Director Hayden: "Over 8000, sir."

Senator Bayh: "And yet this has come from, I guess, only thirty individuals."

The "critical" description in thisCIA representation is addressed in the section of this summary concerning the
reported acquisition of actionable intelligence afterthe use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques that the
CIA represented as enabling the CIA to thwartterrorist plots and capture specific terrorists. See Volume II for
additional information.

Among other documents, see CIA Memorandum for the National Security Advisor (Rice) entitled,
"Effectiveness of the CIA Counterterrorist Interrogation Techniques," December 2004; CIA Memorandum to the

Office of Legal Counsel, entitled, "Effectiveness of theCIACountertenorist Interrogation Techniques," March 2,
2005; CIA briefing notes entitled, "Briefing for Vice President Cheney: CIA Detention andInterrogation Program,"

multi-source intelligence reports are included in the Committee Study, the quantitative analysis in

this summary is basedon sole-source intelligence reporting, as thesereports best reflectreporting from CIA
detainees. Multi-source intelligence reports are reports that contain data from multiple detainees. As described
above, a common multi-source report would result from the CIA showing a picture of an individual to all CIA
detainees at a specific CIA detention site. A report would be produced regardless if detainees were or were not able
to identify or provide information on the individual. As a specific example, see HEADQUARTERS
(202255Z JUN 06), which states that from January 1, 2006 - April 30, 2006, information from Hambali was "used

in thedissemination of three intelligence reports, two of which were non-recognitions of Guantanamo Bay
detainees," wliile the third "detailed [Hambali's] statement thathe knew of no threats or plots to attack any world
sporting events." Sole-source reports, by contrast, are based on specific information provided by oneCIAdetainee.

Director Hayden: "No, sir, 96, all 96."''^^

(^F8yvm^m^H^NF) In April 2007, CIA Director Hayden testified that the CIA's
interrogation program existed "for one purpose - intelligence," and that it is "the most successful
program being conducted by American intelligence today" for "preventing attacks, disabling al-

Qa'ida."^^^*^ At this hearing DirectorHayden again suggested that the CIA interrogation program
was successful in obtaining intelligence from all CIA detainees.^^^^ A transcript of thatheaiing
included the following exchange:

Senator Snowe; "General Hayden. Of the 8000 intelligence reports that were
provided, as you said, by 30 of the detainees."

Director Hayden: "By all 97, ma'am."'^^^
suggestion that all CIA detainees provided information that
resulted in intelligence reporting is not supported by CIA records. CIA records reveal that 34
percent of the 119 known CIA detainees produced no intelligencereports, and nearly 70 percent
produced fewer than 15 intelligence reports. Of the 39 detainees who were, according to CIA
records, subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, nearly 20 percent produced
no intelligence reports, while 40 percent produced fewer than 15 intelligence reports. While the
CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program did produce significant amounts of disseminated
intelligence reporting (5,874 sole-source intelligence reports), this reporting was overwhelmingly
derived from a small subset of CIA detainees. For example, of the 119 CIA detainees identified
in the Study, 89 percent of all disseminated intelligence reporting was derived from 25 CIA
detainees. Five CIA detainees produced more than 40 percent of all intelligence reporting from
the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. CIA records indicate that two of the five
detainees were not subjected to the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques.
F. The Eight Primaiy CIA Effectiveness Representationsâthe Use of the CIA's Enhanced
InteiTOgation Techniques "Enabled the CIA to Disrupt Terrorist Plots" and "Capture
Additional Terrorists"

From 2003 through 2009,'^^"^ the CIA consistently and repeatedly
represented that its enhanced interrogation techniques were effective and necessary to produce

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Briefing by the Director, Central Intelligence Agency, on the Central
Intelligence Agency Detention, Intenogation and Rendition Program, September 6, 2006 (SSCl #2007-1336). At

critical intelligence that "enabled the CIA to disrupt terrorist plots, capture additional terrorists,
and collect a high-volume of critical intelligence on al-Qa'ida." The CIA further stated that the

information acquired as a result of the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques could
not have been acquired by the U.S. government in any other way ("otherwise unavailable").
provided specific examples of counterterrorism "successes" tlie CIA attributed to the use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques.

See list of 20 CIA representations included in this summary. From2003 through 2009, the CIA's
representations regarding theeffectiveness of theCIA's enhanced interrogation techniques included a specific setof
examples of terrorist plots "disrupted" and terroristscaptured that the CIA attributed to information obtained from

the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques. CIA representations further asserted thatthe intelligence obtained
from the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was unique, otherwise unavailable, andresulted in
"savedlives." Among otherCIA representations, sec. (1) CIA representations in theDepartment of Justice Office

of Legal Counsel Memorandum, dated May 30, 2005, which relied on a series of highly specific CIA representations
on the typeof intelligence acquired from theuseof the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques to assess their
legality. TheCIA representations referenced by the OLC include that the use of theCIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques was "necessary" to obtain "critical," "vital," and"otherwise unavailable actionable intelligence" thatwas
"essential" for the U.S. government to "detect and dismpt" terrorist threats. The OLC memorandum further states
that "[the CIA] ha[s] informed [the OLC] that the CIA believes that this program is largely responsible for
preventing a subsequent attack within the United States." {See Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Senior Deputy

General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, from Steven G. Bradbury, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney
General, Officeof Legal Counsel, May 30, 2005, Re: Application of United StatesObligations Under Article 16of
the Convention Against Torture to Certain Techniques that May Be Used in the Interrogation of High Value al
Qaeda Detainees.) (2) CIA representations in the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum
dated July 20, 2007, which also relied on CIA representations on the type of intelligence acquired from the useof
theCIA's enhanced interrogation tecliniques. Citing CIA documents andthe President's September 6, 2006, speech
describing the CIA's interrogation program (which was based on CIA-provided information), the OLC
memorandum states: "The CIA intenogation programâand, in particular, its use of enhanced interrogation
techniquesâis intended to serve this paramount interest [security of the Nation] byproducing substantial quantities
of otherwise unavailable intelligence. ...As the President explained [on September 6, 2006], 'by giving us
information about terroristplans we could not get anywhere else, the program has saved innocent lives.'" {See
Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, from Steven G. Bradbury,
Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, July 20, 2007, Re: Application of the War

Crimes Act, the Detainee Treatment Act, and Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions to Certain Techniques
that May Be Used by the CIA in theInterrogation of High Value al Qaeda Detainees.) (3) CIA briefings for
membersof the National Security Council in July and September 2003 representedthat "the use of Enhanced
Techniques of one kind or another had produced significant intelligence information that had, in the view of CIA

professionals, saved lives,"and warned policymakers that "[t]ermination of this program will result in loss of life,
possibly extensive." {See August 5, 2003 Memorandum for the Record fromScott Muller, Subject: Review of
Interrogation Program on 29July 2003; Briefing slides, CIA Interrogation Program, July 29, 2003; September 4,
2003, CIA Memorandum for the Record, Subject: Member Briefing; and September 26, 2003, Memorandum for the
Record from Muller, Subject: CIA Interrogation Program.) (4) TheCIA's response to the Office of Inspector
General draft Special Review of the CIA program, which asserts: "Information [the CIA] received... as a result of
the lawful use of enhanced interrogation techniques ('EITs') has almost certainly saved countless American lives

inside the United States and abroad. The evidence points clearly to thefact that without theuseof such techniques,
we and our allies would [have] sufferedmajorterrorist attacks involving hundreds, if not thousands, of casualties."

Detention andInteiTogation Activities.) (5)CIA briefing documents for CIA Director Leon Panetta in February
2009, which statethat the "CIA assesses that the RDI program worked andthe [enhanced interrogation] techniques
were effective in producing foreign intelligence," andthat"[m]ost, if notall, of the timely intelligence acquired

The CIA also represented tliat the best measure of effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques was examples of specific terrorist plots "thwarted" and specific
terrorists captured as a result of the use of the CIA's techniques.
For example, in a December 2004 CIA memorandum prepared for
the national security advisor, the CIA wrote that there was "no way to conduct" an

"independent study of the foreign intelligence efficacy of using enhanced interrogation
techniques," but stated, "[t]he CentralIntelligence Agency can advise you that this program
works and the techniques are effective in producing foreign intelligence." To illustrate the
effectiveness of the CIA's interrogation techniques, the CIA provided 11 examples of "[k]ey
intelligence collected from HVD interrogations after applying inten'ogation techniques," nine of
which referenced specific ten'orist plots or the capture of specific terrorists.Similarly, under
the heading, "Plots Discovered as a Result of EITs," a CIA briefing prepared for President Bush
in November 2007 states, "reporting statistics alone will not provide a fair and accurate measure
of the effectiveness of EITs." Instead, the CIA provided eight "examples of key intelligence
collected from CIA detainee inteiTogations after applying the waterboard along with other

interrogation techniques," seven of which referenced specific terrorist plots or the capture of
specific ten-orists.^^^^
The Committee selected 20 CIA documents that include CIA

representations about the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques from
2003 through 2009. The 20 CIA documents, which were consistent with a broader set of CIA
representations made during this period, include materials the CIA prepared for the White
attaclunent, "Key Intelligence and Reporting Derived from Abu Zubaydah and Klialid Shaykli Muhaminad (KSM),"
including "DCIA Briefing on RDIProgiam" agenda, CIA document "EITs andEffectiveness," with associated
documents, "Key Intelligence Impacts Chart: Attachment (AZ and KSM)," "Background on Key Intelligence
Impacts Chart: Attachment," and "supporting references," to include "Background on Key Captures and Plots
Disrupted.") (6) CIAdocument faxed to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on March 18, 2009, entitled,
"[SWIGERT] and [DUNBAR]," located in Committeedatabases at DTS#2009-1258, which provides a list of
"some of the key capturesand dismptedplots" that the CIA had attributed to the use of the CIA's enhanced
intenogation techniques, and stating: "CIA assesses that most, if not all, of tlie timely intelligence acquired from
detainees in this program would not have beendiscovered or reported by any otiier means." See Volume II for
additional CIA representations asserting that tlie CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques enabled the CIA to obtain
unique, otherwise unavailable intelligence that "saved lives."

representations further asserted that the intelhgence obtainedfrom the use of the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation
techniques was unique, otherwise unavailable, and resulted in "saved lives." Among other CIA representations,see:
(1) CIA representations in the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum, dated May 30, 2005,
which relied on a series of highly specific CIA representations on the type of intelligence acquired from the use of
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques to assess their legality. Tlie CIA representations referenced by the

OLC include tliat the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was "necessary" to obtain "critic^,"
"vital," and "otherwise unavailable actionableintelligence" that was "essential" for the U.S. government to "detect
and disnipt" terrorist threats. The OLC memorandum further states that "[the CIA] ha[s] informed [the OLC] that
the CIA believes that this program is largely responsible for preventing a subsequent attack within the United
States." (See Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Senior Deputy General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, from
Steven G. Bradbury, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, May 30, 2005, Re:
Application of United States Obligations Under Article 16 of the Convention Against Torture to Certain Techniques
that May Be Used in the Interrogation of High Value al Qaeda Detainees.) (2) CIA representations in the
Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum dated July 20, 2007, which also relied on CIA

representations on the type of intelligence acquiredfrom the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.
Citing CIA documents and the President's September6, 2006, speech describing the CIA's interrogation program
(which was based on CIA-provided information), the OLC memorandum states: "The CIA interrogation programâ
and, in particular, its use of enhanced interrogation techniquesâis intended to serve this paramount interest [security
of the Nation] by producing substantial quantities of otherwise unavailable intelligence. ...As tlie President

explained [on September 6, 2006], 'by giving us information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhere else,
the program has saved innocent lives.'" (See Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel, Central
Intelligence Agency, from Steven G. Bradbury, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal
Counsel, July 20, 2007, Re: Application of the War Crimes Act, the Detainee Treatment Act, and Common Article 3

of the Geneva Conventions to Certain Techniques that May Be Used by tlie CIA in the Intenogation of High Value
al Qaeda Detainees.) (3) CIA briefings for members of the National Security Council in July and September 2003
represented that "the use of Enhanced Techniques of one kind or another had produced significant intelligence
information that had, in the viewof CIA professionals, saved lives," and warnedpolicymakers that "[t]ermination of
this program will result in loss of life, possibly extensive." (See August 5, 2003 Memorandum for the Record from
Scott Muller, Subject: Review of Interrogation Program on 29 July 2003; Briefing slides, CIA Inteirogation
Program, July 29, 2003; September 4, 2003, CIA Memorandum for the Record, Subject: Member Briefing; and
September 26, 2003, Memorandum for the Record from Muller, Subject: CIA Interrogation Program.) (4) Tlie
CIA's response to the Office of Inspector General draft Special Review of the CIA program, which asserts:
"Information [the CIA] received... as a result of the lawful use of enhanced inteirogation techniques ('ElTs') has
almost certainly saved countless American lives inside the United States and abroad. The evidence points clearly to
the fact that without the use of such techniques, we and our allies would [have] suffered major terrorist attacks
involving hundreds, if not thousands, of casualties." (See Memorandum for: Inspector General; from: James Pavitt,
Deputy Director for Operations; subject: re (S) Comments to Draft IG Special Review, "Counterterrorism Detention
and Interrogation Program" 2003-7123-IG; date: February 27, 2004; attachment: February 24, 2004, Memorandum
re Successes of CIA's Counterterrorism Detention and Interrogation Activities.) (5) CIA briefing documents for CIA
Director Leon Panetta in February 2009, which state that the "CIA assesses that the RDI program worked and the
[enhanced interrogation] techniques were effective in producing foreign intelligence," and tliat "[m]ost, if not all, of
the timely intelligence acquired from detainees in this program would not have been discovered or reported by other
means." (See CIA briefing documentsfor Leon Panetta, entitled, "Tab 9: DCIA Briefing on RDI Program18FEB.2009" and graphic attachment, "Key Intelligence and Reporting Derived from Abu Zubaydah and Khalid

Effectiveness," with associated documents, "Key Intelligence Impacts Chart: Attachment (AZ and KSM),"
"Background on Key Intelligence Impacts Chart: Attachment," and "supporting references," to include "Background

March 18, 2009, entitled, "[SWIGERT] and [DUNBAR]," located in Committee databases at DTS #2009-1258,
which provides a list of "some of the key captures and disrupted plots" that the CIA had attributed to the use of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, and stating: "CIA assesses that most, if not all, of the timely intelligence

acquired from detainees in this program would not have been discovered or reported by any other means." See

CIA to obtain unique, otherwise unavailable intelligence that "saved lives."

specific plots were accurate.The Committee found the CIA's representations to be
inaccurate and unsupported by CIA records.
Below are the summaries of the CIA's eight most frequendy cited
examples of "thwarted" plots and captured terrorists, as well as a description of the CIA's claims
and an explanation for why the CIA representations were inaccurate and unsupported by CIA
records.

1. The Thwarting of the Dirty Bomb/Tall Buildings Plot and the Capture ofJose Padilla
Summary: The CIA represented that its enhanced inten'ogation
techniques were effective and necessary to produce critical, otherwise unavailable intelligence,
which enabled the CIA to disaipt terrorist plots, capture terrorists, and save lives. Over a period
of years, the CIA provided the thwarting of terrorist plotting associated with, and the capture of,
Jose Padilla, as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.
These CIA representations were inaccurate. The CIA first received reporting on the terrorist
threat posed by Jose Padilla from a foreign government. Eight days later, Abu Zubaydah
provided information on the terrorist plotting of two individuals, whom he did not identify by
ti-ue name, to FBI special agents. Abu Zubaydah provided this information in April 2002, prior
to the commencement of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques in August 2002. The plots
associated with Jose Padilla were assessed by the Intelligence Community to be infeasible.

'299 xlye dy\ has representedthat it has provided the SenateSelectCommittee on Intelligence with all CIA records

related to tlie CIA'sDetention and Intenogalion Program. This document production phase lasted more than three
years and was completed in July 2012. The records produced include more than six million pages of material,
including records detailing the interrogation of detainees, as well as the disseminated intelligence derived from the
interrogation of CIA detainees. The CIA did not provideânor was it requested to provideâintelligence records that
were unrelated to the CIA Detention and Interrogation Program. In other words, this Study was completed without
direct access to reporting from CIA HUMINT assets, foreign liaison assets, electronic intercepts, military detainee
debriefings, law enforcement deri ved information, and otlier methods of intelligence collection. Insomuch as this
material is included in the analysis herein, it was provided by the CIA witliin the context of documents directly
related to the CIA Detention and Interrogation Program. For example, a requirements cable from CIA Headquarters
to CIA interrogators at a CIA detention site could cite SIGNALS intelligence collected by NSA, or include a CIA
HUMINT source report on a particulai- subject, with a request to question tlie CIA detainee about the reporting.
While direct access to the NSA report, or the CIA HUMINT report, may not have been provided, it may still be
included in this Study because it appeared in the CIA Headquarters requirements cable relating to the questioning of
a CIA detainee. As such, there is likely significant intelligence related to die terrorist plots, terrorists captured, and
other intelligence matters examined in diis report, that is unrelated to the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program
and within the databases of the U.S. Intelligence Community, but which has not been identified or reviewed by the
Select Committee on Intelligence for this Study. As is detailed in the near 6800-page Committee Study, the
Committee found that there was significant intelligence in CIA databases to enable the capture of the terrorists cited,
and "disrupt" the terrorist plots represented as "tliwarted," without intelligence from the CIA intenogation program.
Had tlie Committee been provided with access to all intelligence available in CIA and Intelligence Community
databases, it is likely this finding would be strengthened further. Finally, as of March 2014, the White House had
not yet provided approximately 9,400 documents related to the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Programâ
equivalent to less than .2 percent of CIA detention and interrogation recordsâpending an Executive Privilege
determination. Tlie Committee requested access to tliese documents in tluee letters dated January 3, 2013, May 22,
2013, and December 19, 2013. The White House did not respond to tlie requests.

Further Details: The Dirty Bomb/Tall Buildings plotting refers to
terrorist plotting involving U.S. citizen Jose Padilla. Padilla and his associate, Binyam
Mohammed, conceived the "Dirty Bomb Plot" after locating information, derived from what the
CIA described as "a satirical internet article" entitled "How to Make an H-bomb," on a computer
at a Pakistani safe house in early 2002.^^Â®^ The article instructed would-be bomb makers to
enrich uranium by placing it "in a bucket, attaching it to a six foot rope, and swinging it around
your head as fast as possible for 45 minutes.Padilla and Mohammed approached Abu
Zubaydah in early 2002, and later KSM, with their idea to build and use this device in the United

States.Neither Abu Zubaydah nor KSM believed the plan was viable,'^^'^ but KSM provided
funding for, and tasked Padilla to conduct, an operation using natural gas to create explosions in

tall buildings in the United States,^^^^ later known as the "Tall Buildings Plot."'^Â®^

such as enriching uranium by placing liquid uranium hexaflouride in a bucket, attaching it to a six foot rope, and
swinging it around your head as fast as possible for 45 minutes. While it appears that Padilla and Zouaoui took the
article seriously, Zubaydah recommended that they take their (cockamamie) ideas to (I believe) KSM in Karachi. It
was at that point that KSM told them to focus on bringing down apartment buildings with explosives, (in other
words: keep your day iobs)." U.K. courts noted "that

For additional background on the Dirty Bomb/Tall Buildings Plotting, see fax from Pat Rowan, Department of

Padilla." The document states: "Jose Padilla is a United States citizen who has been designatedas an enemy
combatant by the President and has been detainedby the military since June 9, 2002. Padilla is commonly known as
\e 'dirty bomber' because early intelligence from a senior al Qaeda detainee [Abu Zubaydah] and Padilla's

intended accomplice [Binyam Muhammad] indicated that he had proposed to senior al Qaeda leaders the use of a
radiological dispersion device, or 'dirty bomb,' against United States targets, or interests, and he was detained by the
military partly on that basis. Based on later and more complete intelligence, including Padilla's own statements
/ during military detention, it now appears that Padilla re-entered the United States after he accepted a mission from al
Qaeda leaders, specifically from Klialid SheikhMohammad ('KSM'), the emir of the attacks of September11, to
destroy one or more high-rise apartment buildings in the United States tlirough the use of natural gas explosions
triggered by timing devices, and had received training, equipment and money for that mission." See also other
records that describe the plotting as targeting tall apartment buildings, without reference to a radiological or "dirty"

The capture of, and the thwarting of terrorist plotting associated
with Jose Padilla, is one of the eight most frequently cited examples provided by the CIA as
evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. Over a period of

years, CIA documents prepared for and provided to senior policymakers, intelligence officials,
and the Department of Justice represent the identification and/or the capture of Jose Padilla,
and/or the disruption of the "Dirty Bomb," and/or the "Tall Buildings" plotting, as examples of
how "[k]ey intelligence collected from HVD inteiTogations after applying interrogation
techniques" had "enabled CIA to disrupt terrorist plots" and "capaire additional terrorists."
The CIA further represented that the intelligence acquired from the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques was "otherwise unavailable" and "saved lives,
Source on Al-Qa'ida," noted: "From late 2001 until early 2003, KSM also conceived several low-level plots,

including an early 2002 plan to send al-Qa'ida operative and US citizen Jose Padilla to set off bombs in high-rise
apartment buildings in an unspecified majorUS city." Similarly, an Intelligence Community report titled, "Klialid

1308 Prom 2003 through 2009, the CIA's representations regarding the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced
intenogation techniques provided a specific set of examples of terrorist plots "disrupted" and terrorists captured that
the CIA attributed to information obtained from the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques. CIA

representations further asserted that the intelligence obtained from the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques was unique, otherwise unavailable, and resulted in "saved lives." Among other CIA representations, see:
(1) CIA representations in the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum, dated May 30, 2005,
which relied on a series of liighly specific CIA representations on the type of intelligence acquired from the use of
the CIA's enhanced intenogation techniques to assess their legality. The CIA representations referenced by tlie
OLC include that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was "necessary" to obtain "critical,"
"vital," and "othei*wiseunavailable actionable intelligence" that was "essential" for the U.S. government to "detect
and disrupt" tenorist threats. The OLC memorandum furtlier states that "[the CIA] ha[s] informed [the OLC] that
the CIA believes that this program is largely responsible for preventing a subsequent attack within tlie United
States." {See Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Senior Deputy General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, from

Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum dated July 20, 2007, which also relied on CIA
representations on the type of intelhgence acquired from the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.
Citing CIA documents and the President's September 6, 2006, speech describing the CIA's interrogation program
(which was based on CIA-provided information), the OLC memorandum states: "The CIA interrogation programâ
and, in particular, its use of enhanced intenogation techniquesâis intended to serve this paramount interest [security
of the Nation] by producing substantial quantities of otherwise unavailable intelligence. ...As the President
explained [on September 6, 2006], 'by giving us information about tenorist plans we could not get anywhere else,

Likewise, the July 20, 2007, Department of Justice Office of Legal
Counsel (OLC) memorandum on the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques used CIAprovided information on Jose Padilla to describe the threat posed by al-Qa'ida and the success of
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques to date. The July 20, 2007, OLC memorandum
states:

"The CIA interrogation programâand, in particular, its use of enhanced
interrogation techniquesâis intended to serve this paramount interest [security
of the Nation] by producing substantial quantities of otherwise unavailable
intelligence. The CIA believes that this program 'has been a key reason why
al-Qa'ida has failed to launch a spectacular attack in the West since 11
September 2001'... We understand that use of enhanced techniques has
produced significant intelligence that the Government has used to keep the
Nation safe. As the President explained [in his September 6, 2006 speech], 'by
giving us information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhere else, the
program has saved innocent lives'.. .For example, we understand that enhanced
interrogation techniques proved particularly crucial in the interrogations of
Khalid Shaykh Muhammad and Abu Zubaydah... Interrogations of
Zubaydahâagain, once enhanced techniques were employedârevealed two

al-Qaeda operatives already in the United States^^^'^ andplanning to destroy a
high rise apartment building and to detonate a radiological bomb in
Washington,

On April 21, 2009, a CIA spokesperson confirmed the accuracy of the information in the OLC
memorandum in response to the partial declassification of this and other memoranda.
The CIA provided similar inaccurate representations regarding the
thwarting of the Dirty Bomb plotting, the thwarting of the Tall Buildings plotting, and/or the
capture of Jose Padilla in 17 of the 20 documents provided to policymakers and the Department

of Justice between July 2003 and March 2009.^^^^

Italics added. CIA records indicate that Abu Zubaydah never provided information on "two operatives already
in the United States." While neither Binyam Muhammad nor Jose Padilla was "already in the United States," the
OLC description appears to be a reference to Jose Padilla and Binyam Mohammad, as the OLC then makes
reference to the "Dirty Bomb" and "Tall Buildings" plotting.
Italics added. See Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, from

to Certain Techniques that May Be Used by the CIA in the InteiTogation of High Value al Qaeda Detainees.
See "Waterboarding Saved L.A.," Washington Times, April 25, 2009. The CIA's June 2013 Response asserts
that it "took [the CIA] until 2007 to consistently stop referring to [Padilla's] 'Dirty Bomb' plotâa plan [the CIA]
concluded early on was never operationally viable." As noted, the CIA continued to refer to the "Dirty Bomb"
plotting through 2007 and confimied tlie information publicly in 2009.

^ review of CIA operational cables and other CIA records found

that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques played no role in the identification of
"Jose Padilla" or the thwarting of the Dirty Bomb or Tall Buildings plotting. CIA records
indicate that: (1) there was significant intelligence in CIA databases acquired prior toâand
independently ofâthe CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program to fully identify Jose Padilla
as a terrorist threat and to disrupt any terrorist plotting associated with him;^^^"^ (2) Abu
Zubaydah provided information on the terroristplotting of two individuals who proposed an idea
to conduct a "Dirty Bomb" attack, but did not identify their true names; (3) Abu Zubaydah

10092 (211031Z APR02). WhileAbuZubaydah was subjected to sleep
deprivation and nudity prior to this date by the CIA, he had been allowedto sleep shortly prior to being questioned
on this matter by the FBI special agents, who were exclusively usingrapport-building interrogation techniques when
the information was acquired from Abu Zubaydah (who was covered with a towel). The sleep deprivation and
nudity as implementedduring this period differedfrom how sleep deprivation and nudity were implemented after
the CIA developed, and the Department of Justiceapproved, the CIA's "enhanced interrogation techniques"in
August2002. Rather than being placedin a stress position during sleepdeprivation, Abu Zubaydahwas kept awake
by being questioned nearly non-stop by CIA and FBI interrogators. Records further indicate that during breaks in

the interrogations, Abu Zubaydah was allowed to briefly sleep. See also I^HHI 10116 (25073IZ APR 02),
which describes this sleep deprivation as a period of "no sustainedsleep" with "cat naps between interrogators."
The cable further states: "Like many medical students, the subject appears to handle 76 plus hours of limitedsleep
with few problems" (italicsadded). The use of nudity during this period also differedfrom future uses of nudity, as
Abu Zubaydahwas covered when interrogated by tlie FBI. See also SSCI Staff interview of FBI Special Agent Ali
Soufan, April 28, 2008, at 1:20 PM, Hart Senate Office Building (transcript at DTS #2008-2411). Ali Soufan
described events prior to Abu Zubaydah's provision of information related to the "Dirty Bomb," stating: "He was
injured, badly injured. He was dehydrated. I remember we were puttingice on his lips. And he didn't have any
bowel control, so we were cleaninghim. And the reason I'm telling you some of these disgusting things is because
it helped build rapport with the guy in this short period of time." Later, Ali Soufan described the provision of

information related tothe Dirty Bomb plotting, statingjJ'When I was going in, he was totally naked. I refused to go

and interview him naked. So I took atowel. And H

I and [REDACTED], every time we went in he had to

be covered or I [wouldn't] go. It's as simple as that." See also section of transcript stating, "So we went back. And
we start talking to him. We took someCoke, tea, and we start talking about different things. We flipped him about
differentthings,
and I and [REDACTED]. And then he came back to his senses and he started cooperating
again. And this is when he gave us Padilla." (Abu Zubaydah provided information concerningthe Dirty Bomb
plotting and Jose Padilla's kimya, but did not provide the name "Jose Padilla." As described in this summary, Jose
Padilla's name had already been provided to the CIA by a foreign government that identified Padilla as a U.S.
citizen suspected of being engaged in possible terrorist activity.) See also Abu Zubaydah detainee review in

Ti;ie Department of Justice finalized its approval of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, including
walling, facial slaps, wall standing, stress positions, sleep deprivation, and the waterboard, as well as other
techniques, on August 1, 2002. See VolumeI and Volume HI for additional details. Beginning on August 4, 2002,
and extending through August 20, 2002, Abu Zubaydah was subjectedto the non-stop concurrent use of the CIA's
enhanced intenogation techniques, including at least 83 applications of the waterboard. CIA records indicate that
tlie use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques ceased on August 30, 2002, when Abu Zubaydah received

Prior to the capture of Abu Zubaydah on March 28, 2002, the CIA
was alerted to the threat posed by Jose Padilla. In early 2001, U.S. government records indicated
that a Jose Padilla came to the U.S. Consulate in Karachi to report a lost passport. These records
indicated that Jose Padilla provided a "sketchy" story about overstaying his Pakistani visa and
that he was "allegedly studying Islamic law in Egypt." A search of the State Department's
Consular Lookout and Support System was conducted at the time, which resulted in "multiple"

hits for "Jose Padilla."^^^Â® State Department records confirmed that Jose Padilla had sought a
new passport at the U.S. Consulate in Karachi in February 2001, and was subsequently provided
with a replacement on March 21, 2001.^-^^^
On December 15, 2001, the CIA provided the FBI with documents
obtained in Afghanistan from a purported al-Qa'ida-related safe house. Included in the binder
were 180 terrorist training camp application forms entitled, "Mujahideen Identification Form /
New Applicant Form." An application form for a then 33-year-old individual with the alias
"Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir" from "America" was among the forms. "Al-Muhajir's" formâdated
July 24, 2000âlisted other identifying information, to include a "10/18/70" date of birth;
language skills to include English, Spanish, and Arabic; travels to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and
Yemen; and the individual's marital status.

from the detainee program." As described in this summary and throughout the full Committee Study, in its efforts to
obtain legal authorization and policy approval for the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, the CIA represented
that the intelligence referenced was obtained "as a result" of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques (not the
"detainee program"), and that the information obtained was unique and otherwise unavailable.
The Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS) is used by State Department passport agencies, post, and
border inspection agencies to perfonn name checks on visa and passport applicants to identify individuals who are,
ineligible for issuance or require other special action. Source: www.state.gov
A February 16, 2001, email entitled, "Lost passport case- Jose Padilla," states that a "Jose Padilla," with a date
of birth of October 18, 1970, came to the U.S. Consulate in Karachi to report a lost passport. The email notes that

"his story is really-sketchy-been traveling here long enough to overstay his Pakistani visa, but speaks no Urdu, and
is allegedly studying Islamic law in Egypt." A March 5, 2001, email in CIA records, entitled, "The continuing Jose
Padilla saga!" states tliat there are "multiple CLASS hits" (Consular Lookout and Support System) for a Jose
Padilla. The author writes "[REDACTED] and 1both agree there is something sketchy about the guy." On March

On April 10, 2002, the CIA disseminated a cable with intelligence
derived from the exploitation of documents obtained during the raids in which Abu Zubaydah
was captured. Included in the CIA cable is a translation of a letter from mid-March 2002 that
references a 33-yeai'-old English-speaking individual. The cable states that the CIA believed this
individual might be involved in "a martyrdom operation." The translation disseminated states:
"There is a brother from Argentina, he speaks Spanish, English and Arabic, he is 33 years old, he
is maiTied and has two little children. He is a great brother. He knows business and studies

English language. He trains [in] selfdefense, he is a good looking man."^^^-^
April 11, 2002, the CIA was provided with
information from Pakistani officials on a 33-year-old U.S. citizen named "Jose Padilla," with a
date of birth of October 18, 1970, who was briefly detained by Pakistani officials on April 4,
2002. The Pakistani government provided a copy of Jose PadiUa's U.S. passport and relayed that
Jose Padilla had overstayed his travel visa, and that there were inconsistencies with Jose
wrote that they would provide the
Padilla's appearance and accent. The CIA's
information on "Jose Padilla" to the State Department's Regional Security Officer, and "would
follow-up with [Pakistani officials] on this matter."
The date of birth and travel information
included with Jose PadiUa's passport matched information on the "Mujahideen Identification
Form" (33-year-old "American" referenced as "Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir") the CIA had

provided to the FBI on December 15, 2001.^^^^
^002, Pakistani officials provided additional

information to the CIA's
specifically that they had detained a U.S. passport holder
named Jose Padilla and a British passport holder named "Fouad Zouaoui" (later identified as
Binyam Muhammad), who had suspiciously attempted to depart Pakistan. According to the CIA
cable, Pakistani authorities provided the information on the pair "due to concerns about possible

terrorist activity."^The cable noted that Pakistani authorities had to release Padilla, but tliat
PadiUa's associate remained in detention.(When questioned further, the Pakistani authorities

provided by a CIA source to CIA officers in Kandaliar, Afghanistan. The CIA officer testified at Jose PadiUa's trial

the CIA was already alerted that a named U.S. citizen, "Jose Padilla," had spent significant time
in Pakistan and was engaged in "possible terrorist activity."^^^^
Eight days after the CIA was informed that U.S. citizen Jose

Padilla was engaged in "possible terrorist activity," on the evening of April 20, 2002, Abu
Zubaydah told FBI special agents about two men who approached him with a plan to detonate a
uranium-based explosive device in the United States (the "dirty bomb"). Abu Zubaydah stated
he did not believe the plan was viable and did not know the true names of the two individuals,

but did provide physical descripdons of the pair.^^^^ This information was acquired after Abu
Zubaydah was confronted with emails that indicated Abu Zubaydah had sent two individuals to
KSM.
The FBI special agents who acquired this information from Abu Zubaydah believed it
was provided as a result of rapport-building interrogation techniques.Abu Zubaydah would

There were no records identified to indicate that the CIA informed tlie FBI at this time that U.S. citizen "Jose

Padilla" was engaged in "possible terrorist activity." As described in Volume 11, once alerted, the FBI identified

links between Jose Padilla and FBI counterterrorism subjects, including an individual who reportedly paid for Jose
Padilla's travel to Pakistan to attend a terrorist training camp.

Committee testimony of FBI Special Agent Ali Soufan on the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah. In the CIA's June
2013 Response, die CIA states the CIA's representation that Abu Zubaydah provided the information after the "use
of DOJ-approved enhanced interrogation techniques"was accurate because, "Abu Zubaydah revealed this
information after having been subjected to sleep deprivation, which would be categorized as an enhanced

interrogation technique once the program wasofficially underway." As described in detail in the Abu Zubaydah

detainee review inVolume III, when Abu Zubaydah was discharged from a hospital in Country |, the CIA sought to
deprive Abu Zubaydah of sleep and to cease Abu Zubaydah's interaction with the FBI special agents who had been
interviewing Abu Zubaydah and acquiring information from him at the hospital. Days later, after this new CIA
approach was implemented, the CIA reversed this decision and the FBI was allowed to question Abu Zubaydah
again. Further, the use of sleep deprivation during this period differed from future uses of sleep deprivation and had
ceased by the time of the referenced FBI interview,as the CIA had determined diat Abu Zubaydah's ability to focus
on questions and provide coherent answers appeared compromised. (See

10071 (190827Z APR 02) and

10116 (250731Z APR 02).) Ali Soufan testified that Abu Zubaydali provided information about the
"Dirty Bomb" plot only after he (Soufan) re-initiated a more traditionalinterrogation approach with Abu Zubaydah,
stating, "We then returned to using the InformedInterrogation Approach. Within a few hours, Abu Zubaydahagain

Padilla prior to reporting from Abu Zubaydah. A CIA officer stated: "the Pakistaniliaison felt it was important to
bring [Padilla] to our attention, given the recent raids...there was enough information indicating that his travel was
suspicious, to put us on alert. This suspicion was enhanced during the debriefings of Abu Zubaydah, which

occurred on 21 April." This is the only known CIA representation that did not fully attribute information on Jose
Padilla to CIA interrogations.

"AZ never really gave 'this is the plot' type of information. He claimed every
plot/operation he had knowledge of and/or was working on was only
preliminary. (Padilla and the dirty bomb plot was prior to enhanced and he

never really gave us actionable intel to get them)."^^'^^
In October 2005, the chief of CTC's CBRN (Chemical,

Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) Group wrote, under the heading, "Don't Put All Your
Uranium in One Bucket":

"Jose Padilla: we'll never be able to successfully expunge Padilla and the
'dirty bomb' plot from the lore of disruption, but once again I'd like to go on
the record that Padilla admitted that the only reason he came up with so-called
'dirty bomb' was that he wanted to get out of Afghanistan and figured that if
he came up with something spectacular, they'd finance him. Even KSM says
Padilla had a screw loose. He's a petty criminal who is well-versed in US
criminal justice (he's got a rap sheet as long as my arm). Anyone who believes
you can build an IND or RDD by 'putting uranium in buckets and spinning
them clockwise over your head to separate the uranium' is not going to

advance al-Qa'ida's nuclear capabilities."'^"^^
other U.S. government assessments also called into
question the "Tall Buildings" plotting, which was loosely based on attacks that were conducted
in Moscow in September 1999 using conventional explosives. The "Tall Buildings" plotting did

not envision the use of conventional explosives.^^"^^ Instead, the plotting envisioned using
natural gas to destroy high-rise residential buildings. As planned, the Intelligence Community

assessed the plotting was not viable.^^"^^ An August 4, 2008, U.S. government assessment stated:
"On the surface, the idea is simplistic, if not amateurish... the probability of an efficient fuel air

explosion is low."^^'^^
Jose Padilla was detained on a material witness warrant from May

Adham Hassoun and Kifah Jayyousi, were found guilty of three criminal offenses relating to

terrorist support activities from October 1993 to November 1, 2001.^^^Â° The case against Jose
Padilla centered on his attendance at a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan in the fall of
2000âspecifically, the terrorist training camp application form acquired by the CIA and
provided to the FBI in December2001. The form was found to have Jose Padilla's fingerprints,
as well as identifying data to include his date of birth, languages spoken, and travels.On
January 22, 2008, Jose Padilla was sentenced to 17 years in prison. On September 19, 2011, the

U.S. 11'^ Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the sentence was too lenient in partbecause it did not
take in account Jose Padilla's prior criminal offenses.

2. The Thwarting of the Karachi Plots
Summary: The CIA represented tliat its enhanced interrogation
techniques were effective and necessary to produce critical, otherwise unavailable intelligence,
which enabled the CIA to disrupt terrorist plots, capture teiTorists, and save lives. Over a period
of years, the CIA provided the thwarting of the Karachi Plot(s) as evidence for the effectiveness
of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. These CIA representations were inaccurate.
The Karachi Plot(s) was dismpted with the confiscation of explosives and the airests of Ammar
al-Baluchi and Khallad bin Attash in April 2003. The operation and arrests were conducted
unilaterally by Pakistani authorities and were unrelated to any reporting from the CIA's
Detention and Interrogation Program.
Fi^rther Details: The Karachi Plot(s) refers to terrorist plotting that
targeted a variety of U.S. and Western interests in the Karachi area, to include the U.S.
Consulate, named hotels near the airport and beach, U.S. vehicles traveling between the
Consulate and the airport, U.S. diplomatic housing, U.S. personnel subject to potential sniper

attacks, as well as Pakistan's Faisal Army Base.'^^^ CIA records indicate the CIA became aware
of the initial plotting as eaily as September 2002, and that it was disrupted in April 2003, when
the remaining plot leaders were arrested in a unilateral operation by Pakistani authorities.
While the plot leaders were captured in the process of procuring explosives, they maintained that
they were stiU in the process of locating vehicles, a safe house, and suicide operatives at the time
of their an-est.^^^^

The thwarting of the Karachi Plot(s) is one of the eight most
frequently cited examples provided by the CIA as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques,Over a period of years, CIA documents prepared for and
provided to senior policymakers, intelligence officials, and the Department of Justice represent
the Karachi Plot(s) as an example of how "[k]ey intelligence collected from HVD interrogations
after applying interrogation techniques" had "enabled CIA to disrupt terrorist plots" and capture

interrogation techniques provided a specific setofexamples of terrorist plots "disrupted" andterrorists captured that
the CIA attributed to information obtained from theuse of itsenhanced interrogation techniques. CIA
representations further asserted thatthe intelligence obtained fromthe useof the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques was unique, otherwise unavailable, and resulted in "saved lives." Among otherCIArepresentations, see:
(1) CIA representations in tlie Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum, dated May 30, 2005,
which reliedon a seriesof highly specific CIArepresentations on the typeof intelligence acquired from theuse of
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques to assess theirlegality. TTie CIArepresentations referenced by the
OLC include that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was "necessary"to obtain "critical,"
"vital," and "otherwise unavailable actionable intelligence" that was "essential"for the U.S. government to "detect
and dismpt" terrorist threats. The OLC memorandum furdier states that "[the CIA] ha[sj informed [the OLC] that
the CIA believes that this program is largely responsible for preventinga subsequent attack within the United
States." {See Memorandumfor John A. Rizzo, Senior DeputyGeneral Counsel, Central IntelligenceAgency, from
StevenG. Bradbury, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Officeof Legal Counsel, May 30, 2005, Re:
Application of United StatesObligations Under Article 16of the Convention Against Torture to Certain Techniques
that May Be Used in the Interrogation of High Valueal Qaeda Detainees.) (2) CIA representations in the
Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum dated July 20, 2007, which also relied on CIA
representations on the type of intelligence acquired from the use of the CIA's enhancedinterrogation techniques.

Citing CIA documents and the President's September 6, 2006, speech describing theCIA's interrogation progiam
(which was basedon CIA-provided information), the OLC memorandum states: "The CIA interrogation programâ
and, in pai'ticular, its use of enhanced interrogation techniquesâis intended to serve thisparamount interest [security
of the Nation] by producing substantial quantities of otherwise unavailable intelligence. .. .As the President
explained [on September6, 2006], 'by giving us information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhere else,
the progiam has saved innocentlives.'" (SeeMemorandum for John A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel, Central
Intelligence Agency, from Steven G. Bradbury, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal
Counsel, July 20, 2007, Re: Application of the War Crimes Act, the Detainee Treatment Act, and Common Article 3

of the GenevaConventions to Certain Techniques that May Be Used by the CIA in the Interrogation of High Value
al QaedaDetainees.) (3) CIA briefings for members of the National Security Council in July and September 2003
represented that "the use of Enhanced Techniques of one kind or anotherhad producedsignificant intelligence
information tliathad, in the viewof CIA professionals, saved hves," and warned policymjikers that "[t]ermination of
this program will result in loss of life, possibly extensive." (See August 5, 2003 Memorandum for the Record from

September 26, 2003, Memorandum for the Record from Muller, Subject: CIA Interrogation Program.) (4) The
CIA's response to the Officeof Inspector General draft SpecialReview of the CIA program, which asserts:
"Information [theCIA] received... as a result of the lawful useof enhanced interrogation techniques ('EITs') has
almost certainly saved countless American lives inside the United States and abroad. The evidence points clearly to
the fact that without tlie use of such techniques, weand our allies would [have] suffered major terrorist attacks
involving hundreds, if not thousands, of casualties." (See Memorandum for: InspectorGeneral; from: James Pavitt,

Response concedes that the CIA "mischaracterized the impact of tlie reporting [the CIA] acquired from detainees on
the Karachi plots," and acknowledges that the Karachi plotting was "thwarted by the arrest of the operatives and the
interdiction of explosives by [Pakistani authorities]." TTie CIA does not dispute that Pakistani authorities arrested
Ammar al-Baluchi and Kliallad bin Attash independently, and that information from the CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program played no role in tlie arrests. The CIA's June 2013 Response states, however, that CIA

detainee reporting "revealed ongoing attack plotting against the US official presence in Karachi that prompted the
Consulate to take further steps to protect its officers." This statement is incongruent with CIA records. In response
to the reporting cited by the CIA, CIA personnel in Karachi wrote: "[w]hile reporting from both [al-Baluchi and bin
Attash] was chilling- [CIA officers] had become aware of most of this reporting either through previous infonnation
or through interviews of al-Baluchi and [Khallad bin] Attash prior to their transfer out of Karachi." The CIA
personnel in Karachi further reassured addressees that, in December 2002, the U.S. Consulate in Karachi took
increased steps to protect U.S. Consulate personnel. See Volume II for additional information.

At least one person in the letter, Khallad bin Attash, a known al-Qa'ida operative,

remained at large.^^^"^
What remained of the Karachi plotting was disrupted unilaterally

by Pakistani authorities as a result ofa criminal lead. On April H, 2003, Pakistani authorities,
speciflcally
received a repoit that explosives and weapons were to
be transported in a pickup truck to a specific location in Karachi
Pakistani authorities made
arrangements to intercede, and, on April 29, 2003, they intercepted the vehicle and confiscated
explosives, detonators, and ammunition. The driver of the vehicle provided the location where
the explosives were being delivered, leading to the capture of several operatives, including
Ammar al-Baluchi and Khallad bin Attash, as well as to the discovery of another explosives
cache. A third captured individual stated that the explosives had belonged to Hamza al-Zubayr,
the known and now deceased al-Qa'ida operative, as well as others residing in the home raided
on September 11, 2002, where the "perfume letter" was discovered.

While being arrested, Ammar al-6aluchi was asked by a Pakistani
officer about his intentions regarding the seized explosives. Al-Baluchi responded that he was
planning to attack the U.S. Consulate in Karachi.In foreign government custodyâand prior
to being rendered to CIA custody and subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniquesâAmmai* al-Baluchi continued to provide information about the Karachi plotting to a
foreign government officer who was using rapport-building interrogation techniques.The
information provided by Ammar al-Baluchi on the plotting included the surveillance conducted,
the envisioned targets, and the exact method of attack that was considered for the U.S. Consulate
in Karachi and other hard targets. Ammar al-Baluchi discussed the use of a motorcycle with a
bomb to breach the perimeter wall of the consulate and then how the operatives would seek to
exploit that breach with a vehicle filled with explosives.Ammar al-Baluchi and Khallad bin

Attash remained in foreign government custody for approximately H weeks, with Ammar alBaluchiâand to a lesser extent bin Attashâresponding to questions on a variety of matters,
including the Karachi plotting.
On May

2003, Ammar al-Baluchi and Khallad bin Attash were

rendered to CIA custody and immediately subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques.
The next day, the CIA disseminated two intelligence reports on the Karachi
Plot(s) from the interrogations of Ammar al-Baluchi and Khallad bin Attash.
The reporting
relayed that: (1) al-Qa'ida was targeting Western interests in Karachi, including the U.S.
Consulate and Western housing in a specific neighborhood of Karachi; and (2) the attack could
have occurred as early as "late May/early June 2003," but the plotters were still in the process of
finding vehicles, a safe house, and the suicide operatives at the time of their arrest.^^^ These
disseminated intelligence reports were used to support CIA representations in finished
intelligence products,talking points, briefing documents, and President Bush's September 6,
was to use a motorcycle bomb and a car bomb in a single, coordinatedattack at the end of May or early June, and he
pointed to the location on the Consulate's perimeter wall where the attack would occur." The information in the

CIA's June 2013 Response is inaccurate. Ammar al-Baluchi provided the referenced information while in foreign
government custody, prior to entering CIA custody and being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation

techniques. Give^h^hre^to U.S. interests, CIA officers sought to participate in the interrogations. AMay 2,
2003, CIA cable (||||||||||H 14291) states that, because ofAmmar al-Baluchi's "strong reticence towards the
U.S.," CIA officers were observing the foreign government interrogations of Ammar al-Baluchi via video feed. The

cable notes that a foreign government officer who had developed rapport with Ammar al-Baluchi was conducting all
the questioning and obtaining intelligence from Ammar al-Baluchi. This included information about the

motorcycle-car bomb plottingagainst the U.S. Consulate, as well as information on plans to potentially target
Westerners in a specific housing area in Karachi. According to the information obtained, surveillance by the plotters
"had confirmed a U.S. presence significant enough to warrant such an attack." Ammar al-Baluchi further stated that

he had considered caijacking a U.S. Consulate vehicleand loadingit widi explosives to target the Consulate, and
elaborated on tlie initial idea to attack the U.S. Consulate with a helicopter, stating that he did not follow through

witli this idea because he believed it would take too long to train an operative for that type of attack {see |[||^^^|
14291, May 2, 2003). Later, theforeign govemment officerdescribed Ammar al-Baluchi as "morechatty" than
Khallad bin Attash, and detailed how,while in foreign government custody Ammar al-Baluchi "acknowledged plans

to attack U.S. Consulate officials at the airport, the Consul General's Residence and the Consulate itself" The

foreign government officer explained tliat "both the Consulate and the CG's residence" required a "tiered attackof
successive car bombs which would breach the perimeter" of the targets. The foreign government officer also stated
that, based on Ammar al-Baluchi's comments on his casing efforts, it was inferred that Ammar al-Baluchi had

sought totarget Americans attheir residences in specific areas of Karachi. See

2006, speech that the Karachi Plot(s) was "thwarted," "disrupted," or "uncovered" as a result of
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. However, within 24 hours of the dissemination of
these intelligence reports, CIA personnel in Karachi responded in an official cable that the
information acquired from the CIA detainees and disseminated was already known to the CIA
and U.S. Consulate officials. The cable stated:

"[w]hlle reporting from both [al-Baluchi and bin Attash] was chilling- [CIA
officers] had become aware of most of this reporting either through previous
information or through interviews of al-Baluchi and [Khallad bin] Attash prior
to their transfer out of Karachi.

(T8/^^^|^^^^H^^TheCIApersonnel in Karachi reassured addressees that, in
December20027^^lmil^^^AH the U.S. Consulate in Karachi took increased steps to
protect U.S. Consulate personnel based on similar terrorist threat reporting. According to the
cable, Americans in the referenced housing area had akeady been vacated from die "area for
several months," the potential for "attacks targeting Americans at the airport" had been
"recognized several months ago," and new procedures and security measures had been put in
place to minimize the risks associated with the potential terrorist attacks.
As noted, in November 2007, the CIA prepared and provided a set

of talking points to the CIA director for an "upcoming meeting with the President regarding the
Waterboard Enhanced Interrogation Technique." Under a secdon endtled, "Plots Discovered as
a Result of EITs," the document lists the "Karachi Plot," stating the disruption was the result of

"key intelligence collected from CIA detainee interrogations after applying the waterboard along
with other interrogation techniques," and that the plotting was ''uncovered during the initial

interrogations of Khallad Bin Attash and Ammar al-Baluchi and later confirmed by KSM."^^^^
While Ammar al-Baluchi and Khallad bin Attash were subjected to the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques, there are no CIA records to indicate that either was ever subjected to
the CIA's waterboard interrogation technique. KSM did provide information on the plotting, but
was assessed by CIA personnel to be withholding information on the plotting, more than a month
after the CIA stopped using its enhanced interrogation techniques against KSM. In late April
2003, CIA inten-ogators confronted KSM with photographs demonstrating tiiat Ammar alamong other documents, the June 2005 CIA Intelhgence Assessment entitled, "Detainee Reporting Pivotal for the
War Against Al-QaMda." CIA records indicate this document was provided to Wliite House officials on June 1,
2005. A slightly modified version of this Intelligence Assessment was broadly disseminated witliin the Intelligence
Community on June 3, 2005. On March 31, 2009, former Vice President Cheney requested the declassification of
this Intelligence Assessment, wliich was publicly released with redactions on August 24, 2009. The assessment
represents that "detainee reporting"resultedin the "[rjevealing of the Karachi Plots," stating: "When confronted
with information provided by Ammar al-Baluchi, Khallad admittedduring debriefings that al-Qa'ida was planning
to attack the US Consulate in Karachi, Westerners at the Karachi Airport, and Western housing areas." The footnote

Baluchi and Khallad bin Attash had been captured. When the CIA interrogators asked what
Ammar al-Baluchi and Khallad bin Attash were "up to" in Karachi, KSM provided information
regarding potential targets in Karachi.KSM's belated reporting prompted the CIA's ALEC
Station to write a cable stating:

"We were disappointed to see that KSM only made these new admissions of
planned attacks in Pakistan after seeing the capture photographs of Ammar alBaluchi and Khallad. We consider KSM's long-standing omission of [this]
information to be a serious concern, especially as this omission may well have
cost American lives had Pakistani authorities not been diligent in following up
on unrelated criminal leads that led to the capture of Ammar, bin Attash, and
other probable operatives involved in the attack plans... Simply put, KSM has
had every opportunity to come clean on this threat and, from our optic, he
deliberately withheld the information until he was confronted with evidence
that we already knew about it, or soon would know about it from Ammar and

Khallad... KSM's provision of the Pakistan threat reporting - only after he
was made aware of the capture of the attack planners - is viewed as a clear

illustration of continued and deliberate withholding of threat information
which he believed had not yet been compromised."
Ammar al-Baluchi, Khallad bin Attash, and KSM remained in CIA

custody until their transfer to U.S. military custody at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in September

2006.'^^^ All three remain in U.S. military custody.
3. The Thwarting of theSecond Wave Plot and the Discovery of the Al-Ghuraba Group
Summary: The CIA represented that its enhanced interrogation

techniques were effective and necessary to produce critical, otherwise unavailable intelligence,
which enabled the CIA to disrupt tenorist plots, capture terrorists, and save lives. Over a period
of years, the CIA provided the "discovery" and/or "thwarting" of the Second Wave plotting and
the "discovery" of the al-Ghuraba group as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced

inten-ogation techniques. These representations were inaccurate. The Second Wave plotting was
disrupted with the arrest and identification of key individuals. The arrests and identifications

11454 (301710Z APR 03). As described in detail in the

intelligence chronology in Volume II, KSM was rendered to CIA custody onMarch

2003, and was immediately

subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. On March 5, 2003, he was "confronted" with the

"perfume letter," at which point hediscussed theletter and its recipient, Hamza al-Zubayr. KSM hadnotyet been
subjected to the waterboard. As described, Hamza al-Zubayr was killed in a September 2002 raid against al-Qa'idarelated safehouses. KSM stated that Khallad bin Attash hadbeen responsible forobtaining operatives for the
Hamza al-Zubayr operation. At the time KSM provided this information, a separate cable statedthat KSM

"continued to denyUi^e has any [knowledge ofj ongoing operations." See [REDACTED] 34513 (052246Z MAR

were unrelated to any reporting acquired during or after the use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques against CIA detainees. Likewise, the al-Ghuraba group was identified
by a detainee who was not in CIA custody. CIA detainees subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques provided significant fabricated information on both the Second Wave
plotting and the al-Ghuraba group.
Further Details: Al-Qa'ida's "Second Wave" plotting refers to

two efforts by KSM to strike the West Coast of the United States with airplanes using non-Arab
passport holders. While intelligence reporting often conflated the "Second Wave" plotting, KSM
viewed the plotting as two separate efforts.
Neither of the two efforts was assessed to be
imminent, as KSM was still engaged in the process of identifying suicide operatives and
obtaining pilot training for potential participants when each effort was disrupted through the
arrest or identification of the suspected operatives and operational planners.
The al-Ghuraba student group was established in late 1999 by

Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) leaders primarily to educate the sons of jailed JI leaders and to groom the
students for potential leadership and operational roles in JI. Some members of tJie al-Ghuraba
group reportedly completed militanttraining in Afghanistan and Pakistan while enrolled at
Islamic universities in Karachi.
Despite CIA representations to the contrary, intelligence and

for CIA OTA in the Directorate of Intelligence, dated June 30, 2003, at 06:25 PM.

Seeintelligence chronology in Volume II for detailed information. See also statements by UnitedStates
government officials, such as a February 9, 2006, White House briefing on "the WestCoastTerrorist Plotby
Frances Fragos Townsend, Assistant to tlie President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism." At this briefing
the White Houseemphasized hov^' "collaboration withour international partners" had "disrupted teiTorist networks
around the worid and serious al-Qaeda plots." Using the "West Coast" plot as an example, Townsend stated that:
"KlialidShaykhMohammed was the individual who led thiseffort. .. .The cell leader was arrested in Febmary of
2002, and as we beginâat that point, the other members of the cell believed that the West Coast plot had been
cancelled [and] was not going forward... the lead guy is anested, which disrupts it in February of '02." When asked
about whether this plotting could be accurately described as a disruption giventhe belief by some that "it never got
far enough to be disrupted," Townsend stated, "there is no question in my mind that this is a dismption." Seealso
May 23, 2007, Wliite House Press Release, entitled, "Fact Sheet: Keeping America Safe From Attack," wliich states,
"We Also Broke Up Other Post-9/11 Aviation Plots. In 2002, we broke up a plot by KSM to hijack an airplane and
fly it intothe tallest building on the West Coast." As described in theStudy, KSM was not detained until March 1,
2003. Tlie CIA's June 2013 Response acknowledges that "[t]he Studyconectly points out that we erred when we
represented that we 'learned' of the Second Wave plotting from KSM and 'learned' of tlie operational cell
comprised of students from Hambali." The CIA's June 2013 Response describes the inaccurate representation as
"imprecision" by the CIA, but nonetheless states that the CIA "continue(s) to assess this was a good example of tlie
importance of intelligence derived from the detainee program"; and contendsâfor the first timeâthat Hambali's
capture "was a critical factor in thedisruption of al-Qa'ida's plan to conduct a 'Second Wave' attack." As described
throughout the Committee Study, in its effortsto obtain legal authorization and policy approval for the CIA's
enhancedinterrogation techniques, the CIA represented thatthe intelligence referenced was obtained "as a result" of
the CIA's enhanced inten'ogation techniques (not the "detainee program"), and that the information obtained was
unique andotherwise unavailable. Asdetailed in this summary andin Volume II, the capture of Hambali was
unrelated to the use of the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques.

Reporting indicates tliat the al-Ghuraba group was similar to tliePan Islamic Party of Malaysia(PAS)'s
Masapakindo, aka Pakindo, organization. Masran bin Arshad wasconnected to Pakindo, and wliile in foreign

government custody, explained that "in 1991JPA^PaiUslami^art^

open source reporting indicate the group was not "tasked with," witting, or involved in any
aspect of KSM's Second Wave plotting.
The "discovery" and disruption of the "Second Wave Plot" (also

known as the "West Coast Plot" and the"TallestBuilding Plot"),^^^^ along with the associated
identification, discovery, and capture ofthe al-Ghuraba "cell," is one of the eight most frequently
cited examples provided by the CIA as evidence for the effectiveness of CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques.Over a period of years, CIA documents prepared for and provided
to senior policymakers, intelligence officials, and the Department of Justice represent the
thwarting anddiscovery of the "Second Wave" plotting and the identification, discovery, or
arrest of the al-Ghuraba group members as an example of how "[k]ey intelligence collected from
HVD interrogations after applying interrogation techniques" had "enabled CIA to disrupt
Student Association known as 'Masapakindo' tohelp facilitate a steady pipeline of PAS religious and military
trainees traveling from Malaysia to Pakistan, sometimes continuing on to Afghanistan, but ultimately returning to
Malaysia. This student association forchildren ofPAS members also was intended to serve as a general support
structure for PAS students who were undergoing Islamic religious training in Pakistan and India. Masapakindo's
headquarters was based in Karachi, Pakistan." See also February 27,2004, Memorandum forCIA Inspector
General from James L. Pavitt, CIA Deputy Director for Operations, entitled "Comments to Draft IG Special Review,
Counterterrorism Detention and Interrogation Program," which contains a February 24, 2004, attachment entitled,
"Successes of CIA's Counterterrorism Detention and Intenogation Activities." See alsoCIA Intelligence Product
entitled, "Jemaah Islamiya: Counterterrorism Scmtiny Limiting Extremist Agenda in Pakistan," dated April 18,
2008. Although this report makes numerous references to the al-Ghuraba group, itdoes not reference the group's

'396 References to the "Second Wave" attacks appeared in public news reports shortly after September 11, 2001,

sometimes in reference to Zacarias Moussaoui. See, for example. The Washington Post, "Suspected Planner of 9/11
Attacks Captured in Pakistan after Gunfight" (09/14/2002) ("Some investigators have theorized that Moussaoui,
whose laptopcomputer contained information about crop dusting, may have been part of a second wave of terror
attacks or a back-up plan instead."); The New York Post, "2"^ Plot Tied to Moussaoui" (09/06/2002) ("French

officials reportedly are claiming that Zacarias Moussaoui was never meant tobethe '20'^ hijacker' but was tobepart
of a 'second wave' of terror."); The Los Angeles Times, "Officials Skeptical as Detainees Say Sept. 11 was First in a
Trio" (10/01/2002) ("Tlie Sept. 11 attacks may have been planned as the first of three terrorist strikes in the United

States, eachprogressively bigger and more devastating than thelast, U.S. officials saidMonday, citing recent
interviews with captured A1 Qaeda operatives.... Since days after Sept. 11, authorities have said tliey were
concerned about a possible 'second wave' of attacks."). Similarly, on May 6, 2006, an affidavit filed by Moussaoui
stated, "I was part of another al-Qaeda plot which was to occur after September 11, 2001."
A November 21, 2005, Newsweek article entitled, "The Debate Over Torture," referenced a member of the

Senate SelectCommittee on Intelligence stating that "enhanced interrogation techniques" worked with KSM to
thwart an al-Qa'idaterrorist plot, which the magazine indicated was the "Second Wave" plot. The article included
thefollowing: "A career CIA official involved with interrogation policy cautioned Newsweek not to put too much
credence in such claims. 'Whatever briefing they got was probably not truthful,' said the official, who did not wish

Citing CIAdocuments and the President's September 6,2006, speech describing the CIA's inteiTogation program
(which was based on CIA-provided information), the OLC memorandum states: "The CIA interrogation programâ
and, in particular', its use of enhanced interrogation techniquesâis intended to serve thisparamount interest [security
of the Nation] by producing substantial quantities of otherwise unavailable intelligence. ...As the President
explained [on September 6,2006], 'by giving us information about teirorist plans wecould not get anywhere else,
the program has saved innocent lives.'" {See Memorandum forJohn A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel, Central

represented that "the useof Enhanced Techniques of one kind or another hadproduced significant intelligence
information that had, in the view of CIA professionals, saved lives," and warned policymakers that "[t]ermination of

Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen, was arrested on immigration charges by the FBI in
Minnesota.

At the time of his an"est, the FBI informed the CIA that the FBI considered

Moussaoui to be a "suspected airline suicide attacker."On January 17, 2002, the FBI
publicly released a statement identifying Faruq al-Tunisi, aka Abderraouf Jdey, a Canadian
citizen, as an al-Qa'ida operative possibly "prepared to commit future suicide terrorist
attacks.Intelligence indicates that al-Tunisi, who remains at large, withdrew from
participating in al-Qa'ida operations.His whereabouts remain unknown.

The subsequent "Second Wave" effort began with KSM's tasking
of several Malaysian nationalsâled by Masran bin Arshadâin late 2001 to attack the "tallest

building in California" using shoe-bomb explosive devices to gain access to a plane's cockpit.
The thwarting of this plotting was also unrelated to the use of the CIA's enhancedinterrogation
techniques. This plot was disrupted withthe arrest of Masranbin Arshad in January 2002. This
arrest was unrelated to CIA detainee reporting.Bin Arshad claimed the effort had "not

advanced beyond the initial planning stages" when KSM "shelve[d] the plan" in December 2001
when Richard Reid exposed the "shoe bomb" explosive method.Beginning in July 2002,
while in the custody of a foreign government, and after the extensive use of rapport-building
interrogation techniques,^^^^ bin Arshad provided detailed information on this "Second Wave"

Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, by the House Permanent SelectCommittee on Intelligence and the Senate

sentenced to life in prison. See Department of Justice, Office of the InspectorGeneral, "A Review of the FBI's
Handling of Intelligence Information Related to the September 11 Attacks," dated November 2004, and released

government briefs, particularly since prosecutors admitted last week that similar representations made in the
Moussaoui case were false. In a letter made public Nov 13, [2007], prosecutors in the Moussaoui case admitted to

Reporting indicates that Zakariaâa Malaysianâwas to be the pilotfor the group of Malaysian individuals that
Masran bin Arshad sought to use in the Second Wave plotting. As noted in the text, Zakaria turned himself into
Malaysian authorities on December 18,2002. Hambaliâwho was associated with these Malaysiansâstated he "did
not know why the operation was cancelled," but surmised it mightbe because of the September 11, 2001, attacks, or
because Zaini Zakaria "got cold feet." Hambalireportedin September 2003 that the head of the operation was
Masran bin Arshad and tliat Zaini Zakaria was the pilot selected to fly the airplane. Hambali coiToborated Masran

bin Arshad's reporting that the other members of the group were MohdFarik bin Amin (aka Zubair), Abd AlRahman bin Mustapha Afifi, and Bashirbin Lap Nazri (aka Lillie). By the time of Hambali's capture, all three were

As described, on Febraary 9, 2006, in a White House briefing on "the West Coast Tenorist Plot by Frances
Fragos Townsend, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism," the White House
emphasized how "collaboration with our international partners" had "disrupted terrorist networks around the world
and serious al-Qaeda plots." Using the "West Coast" plot as an example, Townsend relayed that: "Klialid Shaykh
Mohammed was the individual who led this effort. .. .The cell leader was anested in February of 2002, and as we

beginâat that point, the other members of the cell believed that the WestCoastplot had been cancelled[and] was
not going forward...the lead guy is arrested, which disrupts it in February of '02." When asked about whether this
plottingcould be creditedas a dismption given the beliefby somethat "it nevergot far enough to be disrupted,"
Townsend stated, "tiiere is no question in my mind that tliisis a disruption." See also May 23, 2007, White House

Contrary to CIA representations, the use of the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques against KSM did not result in the "discovery" of KSM's "Second
Wave" plotting. On March 1, 2003, KSM was captured. He was rendered to CIA custody on

March |, 2003, and was immediately subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.
While being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, and in the weeks
afterwards, KSM did not discuss the "Second Wave" plotting.On April 19, 2003â24 days
after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques had ceasedâinterrogators
questioned KSM about Masran bin Arshad and his role in developing a cell for the "Second
Wave" attacks. After being told that Masran bin Arshad had been arrested, KSM told his

interrogators, "I have forgotten about him, he is not in my mind at all." KSM also denied that
"he knew anything about a plot to take out the 'tallest building' in California."^'^^'^ KSM's
reporting prompted ALEC Station to write in a cable that "we remain concerned that KSM's
progression towards full debriefing status is not yet apparent where it counts most, in relation to

threats to US interests, especially inside CONUS."'"^^^
According to a CIA cable, on May 5, 2003, KSM "evenmally

admitted to tasking Masran bin Arshad to target the tallest building in California."^'^-^ KSM
continued, however, to deny aspects of the plottingâsuch as denying the use of shoe-bombs in
the operation, only to confirm the planned use of shoe-bombs in later interrogations.On June
23, 2003, an ALEC Station officer wrote that "[gjiven that KSM only admitted knowledge of
this operation upon learning of Masran's detention, we assess he is not telling all he knows, but
rather is providing information he believes we already possess."KSM was asked about
detained Malaysian national Zaini Zakaria for the first time on July 3, 2003. During the
interrogation, the CIA debriefer stated that there was information suggesting that Zakaria was

funded by al-Qa'ida to take flight lessons in September 2001.'"^-^ KSM denied knowing the
name Zaini Zakaria, but later described "Mussa." The CIA suspected this was an alias for
Zakaria. CIA officers at the detention site where KSM was being interrogated then wrote in a
cable, "[t]he core problem, once again, is the appearance that KSM gave up this critical
information only after being presented with the idea that we might already know something
about it."^430
furtherance of the plotting. Further, a November 2003 cable states that CIA interrogators believed Hambali's role in
al-Qa'ida terrorist activity was more limited than the CIA had assessed prior to his capture and that al-Qa'ida
members did not consider Hambali "capable of leading an effort to plan, orchestrate and execute complicated

operations on his ov^^n." {See Hii^HII 1113(111252Z NOV 03).) The claim in the CIA's June 2013 Response
that the capture of Hambali "resulted in large part from information obtained from" KSM is inaccurate. Details on
the capture of Hambali are described elsewhere in this summary and in greater detail in Volume II.

detailed in Volume II, while still inforeign government custody,

Hambali stated he had a brotlier named "Ruswan Gunawan" who attended Abu Bakr University in Karachi and lived
in a donnitory on or near the campus. According to Hambali, his brother served as his "primary conduit for
communications" with KSM and al-Qa'ida. The information that Hambali provided regarding the true name of his

brother was relayed to CIA Headquarters and to CIA personnel in Pakistan and elsewhere on August 15,2003. The
cable stated that, while Hambali was in foreign government custody, the CIA "learned that" Hambali had a 25-year-

old-brother at Abu Bakr UniversityinK^chi named "Rusman Gunawan." According to Hambali, the brothe^^d

locate Gunawan and that
would check records of the students at Abu Bakr University for
matches to Gunawan. Previous checks for names provided by KSM and other CIA detainees for Hambali's brother
("Abdul Hadi") did not result in matches or locational information. Tlie Director of the CIA Counterterrorism

Center subsequently authorized tlie capture and detention of Hambali's brother based on the infonnation Hambali
had provided in foreign government custody. Thereafter, CIA personnel in
began working to facilitate tlie
capture of Gunawan by Pakistani authorities. Days later, a CIA cable referenced information on the probable

custody, on his four-person Malaysian cell tasked by
to be part of an operation targeting
the West Coast of the United States, as well as July 2002 reporting on Malaysian national Zaini
Zakaria seeking pilot training.
Contrary to CIA representations, the use of the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques against Hambali did not result in the "discovery" of "the Guraba Cell"
that was "tasked with executing the 'Second Wave'" plotting. As noted, in foreign government
custody, Hambali's brother, Gun Gun Ruswan Gunawan, identified "a group of Malaysian and
Indonesian students in Karachi" witting of Gunawan's affiliation with Jemaah Islamiyah.^'^^'^
The cable conveying this information recommended "confronting Hambali" with this
information.While being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, Hambali
was questioned about the al-Ghuraba group and KSM's effort to use airplanes to attack the
United States. Hambali told his CIA interrogators "that some of the members of [the al-Ghuraba
group] were destined to work for al-Qa'ida if everything had gone according to plan," that one

member of the group had "ambitions to become a pilot," that he (Hambali) was going to send
three individuals to KSM in response to KSM's "tasking to find pilot candidates, but never got
around to asking these people," and that "KSM told him to provide as many pilots as he
could.Months later, on November 30, 2003, after three weeks of being questioned by a
In October2003, KSM infomied the CIA that "he did not yet view the [al-GhurabaJ groupas an operational pool

'''"o See [REDACTED] 45953 (151241Z SEP03) and [REDACTED] 1323 (161749Z SEP03). CIA cables describe
how Hambali was repeatedly questioned on this issue wliile being subjected to theCIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques. A CIA cable states: "With the gradual ramp-up of intensity of the session and the use of the enhanced
measures, [Hambali] finally stepped over the line and provided the information." Months later Hambali admitted to
fabricating the information provided. A cable explained that Hambali "gave answers tliat were similar to what was
being asked and what he inferred the interrogator or debriefer wanted, and when the pressure subsidedor he was

told that the information he gave was okay^Hamb^ knew that he had provided the answer that was being sought."

{See â¢â¢

of ElTs, Hambali provided infonnation [on the al-Ghuraba group]... someof whom had beendesignated as the
pilots" for the Second Wave attacks. The CIA's June 2013 Response indicates that the CIA continues to assess that
multiple al-Ghuraba members had an "interest in aircraft and aviation." CIA records do not support this assertion.

debriefer "almost entirely in Bahasa Indonesia," Hambali admitted to fabricating a number of
statements during the period he was being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques, including information on efforts to locate pilots for KSM, Specifically, Hambali
stated "he lied about the pilot because he was constantly asked about it and under stress, and so
decided to fabricate." According to a cable, Hambali said he fabricated these claims "in an
attempt to reduce the pressure on himself," and "to give an account that was consistent with what

[Hambali] assessed the questioners wanted to hear."^'^^ The November 30, 2003, cable noted
that CIA personnel "assesse[d] [Hambali]'s admission of previous fabrication to be credible.
Hambali then consistently described "the al-Ghuraba organization" as a "development camp for
potential future J1 operatives and leadership, vice a JI cell or an orchestrated attempt by JI to

Gunawan. Asked about his interest in aviation, |||||||[| [Person 1] stated that "he was the only member ofthe

The CIA detention site wrote, "[Hambali]'s admission came after three weeks of daily debriefing sessions with

[the case officer] canied out almost entirely in Bahasa Indonesia. [Hambali] has consistently wanned to [the case
officer's] discussions with him, and has provided to [the case officer] additional information that he had avoided in
the past... More tellingly, [Hambali] has opened up considerably to [the case officer] about his fears and
motivations, and has taken to trusting [the case officer] at his word. [Hambali] looks to [the case officer] as his sole
confidant and the one person who has [Hambali]'s interest in mind.... Given this. Base notes [Hambali]'s account
of how, tlirough statements read to him and constant repetition of questions, he was made aware of what type of
answers his questioners wanted. [Hambali] said he merely gave answers that were similar to what was being asked
and what he inferred the interrogator or debriefer wanted, and when the pressure subsided or he was told that the
information he gave was okay, [Hainbali] knew tliat he had provided the answer that was being sought." (See

intelligence clironology inVolume II, including Hljl 1142 (November 30, 2003).) Tlie CIA's June 2013
Response states tliat "[w]e continue to assess [Hambali's] original revelation was correct, however, based on KSM's
claim that he tasked Hambali to identify and train pilots, Hambali's verification of this claim in multiple instances,
and the students' interest in aircraft and aviation." The CIA's June 2013 Response is incongnient with the

assessment of CIA inten ogators at the timeâthat the claim of fabrication was "credible"âas well as with a wide
body of subsequent reporting. CIA records indicate that CIA officers confused intelligence reporting on the
Malaysians involved in the "Second Wave" plottingâan apparent reference to Masran bin Arshad, Zaini Zakaria,
and three other Malaysiansâwith the al-Ghuraba Malaysian student grout

4. The Thwarting of the UnitedKingdom Urban Targets Plot and the Capture ofDhiren
Barot, aka Issa al-Hindi

Summary: The CIA represented that its enhanced interrogation
techniques were effective and necessaiy to produce critical, otherwise unavailable intelligence,
which enabled the CIA to disrupt terrorist plots, capture terrorists, and save lives. Over a period
of years, the CIA provided the capture ofDhiren Barot, aka Issa al-Hindi, and the diwarting of
Barot's United Kingdom Urban Targets Plot as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques. These representations were inaccurate. The operation that
resulted in the identification of a U.K.-based "Issa," the identification of "Issa" as Dhiren Barot,
Dhiren Barot's arrest, and the thwarting of his plotting, resulted from the investigative activities
of U.K. government authorities. Contrary to CIA representations, KSM did not provide the first
reporting on a U.K.-based "Issa," nor are there records to support the CIA representation that
reporting from CIA detainees subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques resulted
in Dhiren Barot's arrest. After the arrest of Dhiren Barot, CIA officers prepared a document for
U.K. authorities which stated: "while KSM tasked al-Hindi to go to the US to surveil targets, he
was not aware of the extent to which Barot's planning had progressed, who Issa's coconspirators were, or that Issa's planning had come to focus on the UK." The plotting associated
Hainbali elaborated that the al-Ghuraba group was similar to the Pan Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS)'s
Masapakindo, aka Pakindo, organization. Masran bin Arshad was connected to Pakindo, and, while in foreign
government custody, explained that "in 1991, PAS [Pan Islamic Party of Malaysia] established a secret Malaysian
Student Association known as 'Masapakindo' tohelp facilitate a steadypipelineof PAS religious and military
traineestraveling from Malaysia to Pakistan, sometimes continuing on to Afghanistan, but ultimately returning to
Malaysia. This student association for children of PAS members also was intended to serve as a general support
structure for PAS students who were undergoing Islamic religious training in Pakistan and India. Masapakindo's
headquarters was based in Karachi, Pakistan." See intelligence clironology in Volume II for additional information,

including [REDACTED] 45915 (141431Z SEP03) and CIA
(160621Z DEC 02). See also February 27,

with Dhiren Barot was assessed by experts to be "amateurish," "defective," and unlikely to
succeed.

Further Details: Dhiren Barot, aka Issa al-Hindi,^'^^ met with alQa'ida leaders in Pakistan in early 2004 to discuss potential terrorist attacks against targets in the

United Kingdom.^"^Â®^ Intelligence reporting indicates that Barot spentFebruary and March 2004
Dhiren Barot was referred to as "Issa," "Abu Issa," "Abu Issa al-Pakistani," and "Issa al-Britani." CIA records
indicate that Dhiren Barot's most common alias, "Issa al-Hindi" (variant "Esa al-Hindi") - the name used to author

the book, "Tlie Army of Madinah in Kashmir" - was uncovered in May 2003 from FBI interviews of an individual
in FBI custody, James Ujaama, aka Bilal Ahmed. Intelligencereporting indicated that Dliiren Barot's, aka Esa alHindi's, "Tlie Army of Madinah in Kashmk" was a well-known book among the U.K. extremist community.
Information on the book was prominently available online in 2002, on, among otlier internet sites, the website of the

book store associated with Moazzem Begg, a U.K. extremist who was arrested and transferred to U.S. ii^ary

custody atGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, in 2002. Tlie cover ofthe book lists "Esa Al-Hindi" as the author (jfjH
â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢280438Z
(280746Z MAY 03)).
Note on CIA records related to U.K.-based "Issas": Two United Kingdom-based al-Qa'ida associates, Dhiren

Barot and Sajid Badat, were known by the same commonaliases, Issa, Abu Issa, Abu Issa al-Britani ("[of] Britain")
and/or Issa al-Pakistani. Both individuals were British Indians who had been independently in contact with senior

al-Qa'ida leaders in Pakistan. Reporting indicated that the Issa(s) were located in the U.K. and engaged in terrorist
targeting of the U.K. The investigation into their true identities was a U.K.-led operation. As a result, the CIA
sometimes had limited insight into U.K.-based activities to identify and locate tlie Issas. Senior CIA personnel
expressedfmstration that the U.K. was not sharing all known information on its investigations, writing in August
2003 that "[tlie FBI is] clearly working closely with the [U.K. service] on these matters and [the CIA is] at the
mercy" of what it is told. Until the arrest of one of the Issas, Sajid Badat, on November 27, 2003, the U.S.
Intelligence Community and U.K. authorities often confused the two al-Qa'ida associates. As a result, the quality

and clarity ofdetainee reporting on the Issas (including reporting from detainee^iUh^ustod^^e CIA, U.S.
military, Depailment of Justice, and foreign services) varied. CIA personnel
reported in
September 2003 that there were "two (or three) Abu Issas" in intelligence reporting and fliat, because of their
similarities, it was often "unclear which Issa the detainees [were] referring to at different stages." Once detained in

the United Kingdom in November 2003, Sajid Badat (one of the Issas) cooperated with U.K. autliorities and
provided information about tlie other "Issa." Badat stated that "people often asked [Badat] about [the other] Issa, as
they were both British Indians." According to Sajid Badat, "anyone who had been involved with jiliad in Britain
since the mid-90s" would know Issa al-Hindi (aka Dhiren Barot), to include Babar Alimed, Moazzem Begg, Richard
Reid, Zacarias Moussaoui, and KSM. Dhiren Barot (the other Issa), anested on August 3, 2004, was found to have

been especially well-known among the U.K. extremist community, having written a popular book in 1999
expounding the virtues of jihad in Kashmir under the alias, "Esa al-Hindi." CIA records include a reference to the
book and a description of its author ("a brother from England who was a Hindu and became a Muslim.. .[who] got

training in Afghanistan j^/^a^arly as December 1999. {See information disseminated by the CIA on 12/31/99 in
|.)
[A foreign partner] would later report that Dhiren Barot "frequently" appeared "in
reporting of terrorist training" and "involvement in Jihad in occupied Kashmir, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Malaysia,
throughout the 1990s." As described, the Committee Study is based on more tiian six million pages of material
related to the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program provided by the CIA. Access was not provided to
intelligence databases of the CIA, or any other U.S. or foreign intelligence or law enforcement agency. Insomuch as
intelligence from these sources is included, it was, unless noted otherwise, found within tlie CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program material produced for this Study. It is likely that significant intelligence unrelated to the

CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program on Sajid Badat and Dhiren Barot exists in U.S. intelligence and law

enforcement records and databases. {See intelligence chronology in Volume II, including: ALEC^^^|(112157Z

CIA WASHINGTON DC â¢||| â¢BIHiH-

^lA has

represented that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques resulted in the identification and arrest of
"Abu Talha al-Pakistani." Tlie CIA's June 2013 Response states that Abu Talha's arrest and debriefing was
"invaluable to our overall understanding of Issa's activities and the threat he posed," and claims that Abu Talha's
arrest "would not have happened if not for reporting from CIA-held detainees." CIA records do not support this
statement. CIA records indicate that Abu Talha was identified and located independent of information from CIA

detainees. Abu Talh^MP^stani, a Pakistani with links to U.K. extremists, was identified through information

derived from British m||| [intelligence collection] and the U.K. investigation ofU.K.-based extremist Baber
Ahmed and his associates. These individuals were already under investigation by the B|| [foreign partner].
Further, Baber Ahmed was known to the U.S. intelligence and law enforcement authorities prior to any CIA
detainee reporting. Foreign government authorities, relying on information provided by die United Kingdom and, to
an extent, U.S. signals intelligence, ultimately located and arrested Abu Talha al-Piikistani. Because of the central

role of U.K. authorities, CIA records do not include a comprehensive accounting of the investigation and operations
that led to Abu Talha al-Pakistani's detention. CIA records indicate, however, that Abu Talha al-Pakistani was

identified by two detainees in foreign governmentcustody, shortly after their capture. (Both detainees would later
be transferred to CIA custody and subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.) The first of these two
detainees was Majid Khan, who on March 6, 2003, discussed Ammar al-Baluchi's Karachi-based assistant, "Talha."

Majid Khan provided a phone numberfor Talha, and used that number at the request of his captors in an effort to
locate and capture Ammar al-Baluchi through Talha. Tliis reporting, which Majid Khan provided while he was in
foreign government custody,preceded any reporting from CIA detainees. The other detainee who reportedon Abu
Talha was Ammar al-Baluchi, who described him as "Suliman" and stated that he had been dispatched to the United
Kingdom to recruit operatives suitable for hijacking and suicideoperations. Ammar al-Baluchi was also in foreign
government custody at the time of this disclosure. KSM's failure to mention Abu Talha/"Suliman," more than a

month after the CIA had ceased using its enhanced interrogation techniques against him, prompted one of KSM's
debriefers to state that "KSM could be in trouble very soon." KSM also fabricated that he had shown a sketch
related to the Heathrow Airport plot to Ammar al-Baluchi, rather than to Abu Talha, until confronted with Ammar

al-Baluchi's denials, more than threemonths afterthe use of the CIA's enhancedinterrogation techniques against

KSM hadceased^5eeVolumeII and the KSM detainee review in Volume El foradditional information.

Plot was disrupted when Dhiren Barot and his U.K.-based associates were detained in the United

Kingdom in early August 2004.^'^^'^ On August 24, 2004, U.K. authorities informed the CIA that
the criminal charges against Barot and his co-conspirators "were mainly possible owing to the
recovery of terrorist-related materials during searches of associated properties and vehicles

following their arrests."''^^^ In September 2004, an Intelligence Community assessment stated
that Dhiren Barot was "in an early phase of operational planning at the time of his capture," and
that there was no evidence to indicate that Barot had acquired the envisioned materials for the
attacks.In December 2005, an FBI assessment stated, "the main plot presented in the Gas
Limos Project is unlikely to be as successful as described," concluding, "we assess that the Gas
Limos Project, while ambitious and creative, is far-fetched.On November 7, 2006, Dhiren
Barot was sentenced to life in prison. On May 16, 2007, Barot's sentence was reduced from life
in prison to 30 years after a British Court of Appeal found that expert assessments describing the
plot as "amateurish," "defective," and unlikely to succeed were not provided to the sentencing
judge.
thwarting of the United Kingdom Urban Targets Plot and the
identification and/or capture of Dhiren Barot, aka Issa al-Hindi, is one of the eight most

frequently cited examples provided by the CIA as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques. Over a period of years, CIA documents prepared for and
provided to senior policymakers, intelligence officials, and the Department of Justice represent
the identification and/or arrest of Dhiren Barot, and/or the disruption of his U.K. plotting, as an

example of how "[k]ey intelligence collected from HVD interrogations after applying
interrogation techniques" had "enabled CIA to disrupt terrorist plots" and "capture additional
terrorists."^"^^^ In at least one document prepared for the president, the CIA specifically
coordinated fact sheet and states the following regarding Dhiren Barot and his U.K. attack planning: "Issa al-

Hindiâwho previously traveled to and cased a number of financial targets in the USâmet with al-Qa'ida leaders in
Pakistan in etirly2004 to discuss attack planning against targets in the UK. Issa spent February and March 2004 in
Shkai, Pakistan, witli senior al-Qa'ida explosives expert 'Abd al-Rahman al-Muhajir, probably refining plans to use
vehicle bombs against UK targets. Issa's reports, which were recovered in a raid in mid-2004, discussed ramming a
fuel tanker into a target and parking explosives-laden courier vans or limousines in undergiound garages.
Disruption: Issa and members of his cell were detained in the UK in early August 2004âsoon after the arrest of key

Hamza Rabi'a subordinate Abu Talha al-Pakistani in HBj Pakistan."

See document entitled, "DCIA Talking Points: Waterboard 06 November 2007," dated November 6, 2007, with

the notation the document was "sent to DCIA Nov. 6 in preparation for POTUS meeting."
From 2003 through 2009, the CIA's representations regarding the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques provided a specific set of examples of terrorist plots "disrupted" and terrorists captured that
the CIA attributed to information obtained from the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques. CIA
representations further asserted that the intelligence obtained from the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques was unique,otherwise unavailable, andresulted in "saved lives." Among other CIA representations, see:
(1) CIA representations in the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum, dated May 30, 2005,
which relied on a series of highly specificCIA representations on the type of intelligence acquired from the use of
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques to assess their legality. The CIA representations referenced by the
OLC include that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was "necessary" to obtain "critical,"
"vital," and "otherwise unavailableactionable inteUigence" that was "essential" for the U.S. government to "detect
and disrupt" terrorist threats. The OLC memorandum further states that "[the CIA] ha[s] informed [tlie OLC] that

the CIA believes that tliis program is largely responsible for preventing a subsequent attack within the United
States." {See Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Senior Deputy General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, from
Steven G. Bradbury, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, May 30, 2005, Re:
Application of United States Obligations Under Article 16 of the Convention AgainstTorture to CertainTechniques
that May Be Used in the Interrogation of High Value al Qaeda Detainees.) (2) CIA representations in the
Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum dated July 20, 2007, which also relied on CIA
representations on the type of intelligence acquired from the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.
Citing CIA documents and the President's September 6, 2006, speech describing the CIA's interrogation progiam
(which was based on CIA-provided information), die OLC memorandum states: "The CIA intenogation programâ
and, in particular, its use of enhanced interrogation techniquesâis intended to serve tliisparamount interest[security
of the Nation] by producing substantial quantities of otherwise unavailable intelligence. ...As the President
explained [on September 6, 2006], 'by giving us information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhereelse,
the program has saved innocent lives.'" (See Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel, Central
Intelligence Agency, from StevenG. Bradbury, Principal Deputy Assistant AttorneyGeneral, Office of Legal

of the Geneva Conventions to Certain Techniques that May Be Used by the CIA in the Interrogation of High Value
al Qaeda Detainees.) (3) CIA briefings for members of die National SecurityCouncil in July and September2003
represented that "the use of EnhancedTechniques of one kind or another had produced significant intelligence
information that had, in the view of CIA professionals, saved lives," and wiirned policymakers that "[t]ermination of
this program will result in loss of life, possibly extensive." (See August 5, 2003 Memorandum for the Record from

CIA's response to the Office of Inspector Generaldraft Special Review of the CIA program, which asserts:
"Information [the CIA] received... as a result of the lawful use of enhanced interrogation techniques ('EITs') has
almostcertainlysaved countless American hves inside the United States and abroad. Tlie evidencepoints cleariyto

Director Leon Panetta in February 2009, which state that the "CIA assesses that the RDI program worked and the
[enhanced interrogation] techniques were effective in producing foreign intelligence," and that "[m]ost, if not all, of
the timely intelligence acquiredfrom detainees in this program would not have been discoveredor reported by other

that the "CIA assesses...tlie techniques were effective in producing foreign intelligence," and
that "most, if not all, of the timely intelligence acquired from detainees in this program would

"some of the key captures, disrupted plots, and intelligence" attributed to CIA interrogations.
The document includes the following:

"KSM reports on an unidentified UK-based operative, Issa al-Hindi, which
touches off an intensive CIA, FBI and [United Kingdom] manhunt."
Likewise, a December 2004 CIA memorandum prepared for

National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice responded to a request "for an independent study of
the foreign intelligence efficacy of using enhanced interrogation techniques." The CIA
responded, "[t]here is no way to conduct such a study," but stated that the "CIA's use of DOJEffectiveness," with associated documents, "Key Intelligence Impacts Chart: Attachment (AZ and KSM),"

CIA represented led to the arrest of Dhiren Barot or the thwarting of his plotting.The review
found that the intelligence that alerted security officials to: (1) the potential terrorist threat posed
by one or more U.K.-based operatives with the alias "Issa"; (2) Issa's more common alias, "Issa
al-Hindi"; (3) Issa al-Hindi's location; (4) Issa al-Hindi's ti-ue name, Dhiren Barot; and (5)
information on Dhiren Barot's U.K. plotting, all came from intelligence sources unrelated to the

CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.^"^^^ Contrary to CIA representations, reporting from
CIA detainees subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques did not lead to the arrest
of Dhiren Barot or the thwarting of the United Kingdom Urban Targets Plot, nor did KSM
provide the first reporting on a U.K.-based "Issa." Rather, the disruption of the United Kingdom

attributable to the effoits of U.K. law enforcement^^^^^^^H||^^H||, as well as

m m [a review of computer hard drives], l^^^^^^^^mi^llected

communications], and reporting from detainees in the custody of the U.S. Department of Justice,
the U.S. military, and a foreign government. While records indicate KSM did provide the initial
information on "Issa's" tasking to conduct casings in the United States prior to the September 11,

2001, attacks,'"^^- as well as information on an emailaddress related to Issa,^"^^^^ this information
was provided within a larger body of fabricated reporting KSM provided on Issa. The CIA was
unable to distinguish between the accurate and inaccurate reporting, and KSM's varied reporting
led CIA officers to conclude that KSM was "protecting" Issa^'^^'^ and "obstructing [the CIA's]
ability to acquire good information" on the U.K.-based operative well after the CIA ceased using
enhanced interrogation techniques against KSM.^"^^^

CIA records indicate that CIA detainees largely provided corroborative reporting on Abu Issa, aka Dhiren Barot,
and that CIA representations that "most, if not all, of the timely intelligence acquired from detainees in this program
would not have been discovered or reported by otlier means," is not supported by CIA records. See intelligence
clironology in Volume 11 for additional details.

Dhiren Barot's anest by U.K. authorities was also unrelatedto reporting from the CIA's Detention and
InteiTogation Program. See information in this summary, as well as tlie intelligence chronology in Volume II.
When Issa's U.S. casing reports were found on Abu Talha al-Pakistani's computer, KSM stated that he did not

know ofany al-Qa'ida plans, by Abu Talha oranyone else, totarget th^Citigroup/Citibanl^uilding^n^^
Group building, or the United Nations building in New York. {See

Nonetheless, KSM's reporting on Issa's travel to the U.S. was later corroborated by FBI reporting and individuals
detained by foreign governments. See FBI IIR

Ressam, who was in a U.S. federal prison (arrested by U.S. border patrol with explosives in his
vehicle in December 1999), reported that a U.K. national named "Issa" attended a terrorist
training camp associated with al-Qa'ida in Afghanistan.

Beginning in mid-2002, there was increasing intelligence reporting

possibly planning attacks in the United Kingdom.This reporting resulted in efforts by U.K.

book prominently advertised among the "Recommended Products" in 2002 on the website for the Maktabah alAnsar bookstore (www.maktabah.net/books/images/kashmir.jpg: internet archive 2002). The website archive from
2002 states that the author "Esa al-Hindi" converted "to Islam at the age of 20" and recalls his "personal experience

in occupied Kashmir fighting the Indian forces." The bookstore's website and related jihadi websites list the author
of the book as "Esa Al-Hindi." CIA cables suggest it was not until June 2003 that the CIA conducted an internet

search for "The Army of Madinali in Kashmir." When the search was conducted, the CIA found^^^one of the

plotting.'^^^ On March 17, 2003, KSM stated that, prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks, he
tasked Issa to travel to the United States to "collect information on economic targets." On March
21, 2003, KSM was waterboarded for failing to confirm interrogators' suspicions that KSM
sought to recruit individuals from among the African American Muslim community. KSM then
stated that he had talked with Issa about contacting African American Muslim groups prior to
September 11, 2001
The next day KSM was waterboarded for failing to provide more
information on the recruitment of African American Muslims. One hour after the waterboarding
session, KSM stated that he tasked Issa "to make contact withblack U.S. citizen converts to

Islam in Montana," and that he instructed Issa to use his ties to Shaykh Abu Hamza al-Masri, a
U.K.-based Imam, to facilitate his recruitment efforts.KSM later stated that Issa's mission

in the United States was to surveil forests to potentially ignite forest fires.^^Â®^ During this period,

KSM was confronted with aseries of emailsthati^

the aforementioned "Lazylozy" email'

account and another email account
KSM confirmed that the emails were
established for communication between Issa al-Britani and Ammaral-Baluchi and stated that
Issa used the "Lazylozy" account, and that al-Baluchi used the
account. 1503 (A

month later the CIA reported that Issa did not use the "Lazylozy" email address, but the other

email address.)

Over the next six months, KSM retracted or provided conflicting reporting on

Issa. On June 22, 2003, CIA interrogators reported that "[KSM] nervously explained to

recruitment in Montana, and "simply told his interrogators what he thought tliey wanted to

KSM's fabrication claims were "another resistance/manipulation ploy" and characterized KSM's
contention that he "felt 'forced' to make admissions" under enhanced interrogation techniques as
"convenient excuses." As a result, ALEC Station urged CIA officers at tiie detention site to get

KSM to reveal "who is the key contact person in Montana?"^^Â®^ By June 30, 2005, ALEC
Station had concluded that KSM's reporting about African American Muslims in Montana was
"an ouUight fabrication."

On April 4, 2003, the CIA provided reporting to the U.K. on

"Issa," stating that "we realize that Abu Issa is a target ofinterest to your service." The
information compiled by the CIA included an August 2002 report (um'elated to the CIA s
Detention and Inten*ogation Program) that stated that a U.K. national "Abu Issa Al-Pakistani"

was slated by al-Qa'ida for "terrorist operations against foreign targets."^^Â®^ On April 18, 2003,

The same cable notes that KSM had changed his reporting on Issa's

claimed that Issa was of Indian origin. The CIA wrote that KSM's reporting:

"tracks widi reporting from anotiier detainee. As you are aware, Feroz Abbasi

August 1, 2004, Abu Talha was shown a photograph of Dhiren
Barot and "immediately identified him as Issa." Abu Talhaâwho was cooperating with foreign

government authoritiesâdescribed Issa's visit to Pakistan from February to April 2004, during
which he stated "Issa" (aka Dhiren Barot) met with Hamza al-Rabi'a on multiple occasions to

"discuss operations in the United Kingdom and targets already cased in the United States." Abu

Talha stated that Issa believed his activities and identity were not known to the authorities.^'''^'
An August 3, 2004, cable stated that "analysis of information on
[the] hard drive" of the computer seized "revealed a document... that is a detailed study on the
methodologies to affect a terrorist attack." According to the cable, "the study describes the
operational and logistics environment in the UK." The document is divided into two main parts.
The first part includes seven chapters on the topic entitled "rough presentation for gas limo
project." The second part is entitled "rough presentation for radiation (dirty bomb) project."
The "gas limo project" section concludes that the most feasible option would be to use a
limousine to deliver explosives, while the "dirty bomb" project section states that smoke
detectors could be used to deliver the radioactive substance americium-147. The document

proposes to use 10,000 smoke detectors as part of an explosive device to spread this radioactive
element. In addition, the document discusses the vulnerabilities of trains and the possibilities of

hijacking and utilizing gasoline tankers to conduct a terrorist attack.

associated properties and vehicles following their arrests.

On August 23, 2004, the CIA received an update from H
[foreign partner] authorities that noted the "research conducted by the [Barot] network into

central London hotels and railway stations [is] likel^o be exploratory rather than representing a
detailed operational plan."^^'^^ Areport from the

[foreign partner] stated:

"material that is emerging from [the United Kingdom] investigation, combined
with detainee reporting from senior al-Qa'ida members [an appai-ent reference
to Abu Tatha al-Pal^istani's reporting on U.K. targeting in Pakistani custody],
strongly suggests that Barot's cell was planning a terrorist attack in the U.K.,
what is not yet clear is how close the cell was to mounting an attack or what, if
any, targets had been finalized."

August 30, 2004, talking points on the Dhiren Barot case were
prepared by CIA officers. A CIA officer wrote that KSM's reporting on contact numbers for

Issa was "a dead end" and "that it appears KSM was protecting al-Hindi."^^'^'-^ The talking points
highlighted the cyber capabilities enabled by the USA PATRIOT Act in the investigation of
Dhiren Barot, stating:

Exploitation of computers and other information obtained in raids before and
during the case also contributed significantly, as did surveillance. However,
none of these tools are stand-alones. Good old fashioned hard targeting and

analysis of these maddeningly vague and disparate and incomplete threads of
information was the glue that put it all together.

On September 10, 2004, the Interagency Intelligence Committee
on Terrorism (IICT) disseminated a report entitled, "Homeland: Reappraising al-Qa'ida's
Election Threat," which states:

"We do not know the projected timeframe for any attacks Issa was planning to
execute in the UK, but it is unlikely he would have been ready to strike in the
near term. Upon returning to the UK in mid-2004, Issa attempted to gather
materials to build explosives for future attacks in the UK... lU.K.] authorities
have been unable to locate any explosives precursors, and it is possible he had
not yet acquired the necessary materials at the time of his detention. The
detainee [Abu Talha al-Pakistani] also noted that some of Issa's operatives
required further trainingâmost likely in explosivesâand that [Issa] intended
to send an associate to Pakistan for thiee months to receive instruction from

senior al-Qa'ida explosives experts."

The assessment adds, "Issa appears to have been in an early phase of operational planning at the

time of his capture."^^^^

In November 2004, H

authorities informed the CIA that "it was

largely tiii'ough the investigation of Nisar Jalal's associates that [the U.K.] was able to identify

Dhiren Barot as being [identifiable] with Issa al-Hindi."^^^^
A December 14, 2004, FBI Intelligence Assessment entitled, "The

Gas Limos Project: An al-Qa'ida Urban Attack Plan Assessment," evaluated "the feasibility and
lethality of this plot" based on "documents captured during raids" against "al-Qa'ida operatives
in Pakistan and the United Kingdom in July and August 2004, and on custodial interviews
conducted in the weeks following these raids." The FBI concluded that "the main plot presented
in the Gas Limos Project is unlikely to be as successful as described." The report continued:

thwarted plots and saved lives. Over a period of years, the CIA provided the "identification,"
"arrest," "capture," "investigation," and "prosecution" of lyman Faris as evidence for the
effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. These representations were
inaccurate. lyman Faris was identified, investigated, and linked directly to al-Qa'ida prior to any
mention of lyman Faris by KSM or any other CIA detainee. When approached by law
enforcement, lyman Faris voluntarily provided information and made self-incriminating
statements. On May 1, 2003, lyman Faiis pled guilty to terrorism-related charges and admitted
"to casing a New York City bridge for al Qaeda, and reseai'ching and providing information to al
Qaeda regarding the tools necessary for possible attacks on U.S. targets."
Further Details: lyman Faris was an Ohio-based truck driver

tasked by KSM with procuring "tools and devices needed to collapse suspension bridges," as
well as tools that could be used to derail trains.Faris had met KSM through his selfdescribed "best friend," Maqsood Khan,'^^^ who was a Pakistan-based al-Qa'ida facilitator and
Majid Khan's uncle.

The identification and arrest of lyman Faris is one of the eight most
frequently cited examples provided by the CIA as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's

enhanced interrogation techniques. Over a period of years, CIA documents prepared for and
provided to senior policymakers, intelligence officials, and the Department of Justice represent
the identification, capture, and/orarrest of lyman Faris as an example of how "[k]ey intelligence

the intelligence acquired from the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was "otherwise
unavailable" and "saved lives.

Italics included in CIA Memorandum to the Office of Legal Counsel, entitled, "Effectiveness of tlie CIA
Counterterrorist Interrogation Techniques," from March 2, 2005.

i56> From 2003 tluough 2009, the CIA's representations regarding the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques provided a specific set of examples of tenorist plots "disrupted" and tenorists captured that

the CIA attributed to information obtained from the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques. CIA

representations further asserted that the intelligence obtained from the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques was unique,otherwise unavailable, and resulted in "savedlives." Among other CIA representations, see:
(1) CIA representations in the Department of JusticeOffice of Legal Counsel Memorandum, dated May 30, 2005,
which relied on a series of highly specific CIA representations on the type of intelligence acquired from the use of
the CIA's enhanced intenogation techniques to assess their legality. Tlie CIA representations referenced by the
OLC include that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was "necessary" to obtain "critical,"
"vital," and "otherwise unavailable actionable intelligence" that was "essential" for the U.S. government to "detect
and disrupt" terroristthreats. The OLC memorandum furtlier states that "[die CIA] ha[s] informed [the OLCJ that
the CIA believes that this program is largely responsible for preventing a subsequent attack within die United
States." (See Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Senior Deputy General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, from

Steven G. Bradbury, PrincipalDeputy AssistantAttorney General,Officeof Legal Counsel, May 30, 2005, Re:
Application of UnitedStatesObligations UnderArticle 16of the Convention Against Torture to CertainTechniques
that May Be Used in the Interrogation of High Valueal Qaeda Detainees.) (2) CIA representations in the
Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum dated July 20, 2007, which also relied on CIA
representations on the type of intelligence acquired from the use of the CIA's enhancedinterrogation techniques.
Citing CIA documents and the President's September 6,2006, speech describing the CIA's interrogation program
(which was based on CIA-provided information), the OLC memorandum states: "The CIA interrogation programâ
and, in particular, its use of enhancedinterrogation techniquesâis intended to serve this paramountinterest [security
of the Nation] by producing substantial quantities of otherwise unavailableintelligence. ...As the President
explained [on September6, 2006], 'by giving us information aboutteiTorist plans we could not get anywhere else,
tlie programhas saved innocentlives.'" (See Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, ActingGeneral Counsel,Central
Intelligence Agency, from Steven G. Bradbury, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal
Counsel, July 20, 2007, Re: Application of tlieWar Crimes Act, the Detainee Treatment Act, and Common Article 3
of the Geneva Conventions to Certain Techniques that May Be Used by the CIA in the Interrogation of High Value
al Qaeda Detainees.) (3) CIA briefings for members of the National Security Council in July and September 2003

represented that "the use of EnhancedTechniques of one kind or anotherhad produced significant intelligence
information that had, in the view of CIA professionals, saved lives," and warned policymakers that "[t]ermination of
this program will result in loss of life, possibly extensive." (See August 5, 2003 Memorandum for the Recordfrom

Program, July 29, 2003; September 4, 2003, CIA Memorandumfor the Record, Subject: Member Briefing; and
September 26, 2003, Memorandum for the Record from Muller, Subject: CIA Intenogation Program.) (4) The
CIA's response to the Office of Inspector General draft Special Review of the CIA program, wliich asserts:
"Information [the CIA] received... as a result of the lawful use of enhanced interrogation techniques ('EITs') has
almost certainly saved countless American lives inside the United States and abroad. The evidence points clearly to
the fact that without the use of such techniques, we and our allies would [have] suffered major teiToristattacks
involving hundreds, if not thousands, of casualties." (See Memorandum for: InspectorGeneral; from: James Pavitt,

and Interrogation Program" 2003-7123-IG; date: February 27, 2004; attachment: February24, 2004, Memorandum
re Successes of CIA's Counterterrorism Detention and Interrogation Activities.) (5) CIA briefing documents for CIA
Director Leon Panetta in February 2009, which state that the "CIA assesses that the RDI program worked and the
[enhanced interrogation] techniqueswereeffective in producing foreign intelligence," and that "[m]ost, if not all, of
the timely intelligence acquiredfrom detainees in this program would not have been discovered or reported by other
means." (See CIA briefing documents for Leon Panetta, entitled, "Tab 9: DCIA Briefing on RDI Program-

(^I^^i^^^HIIIIIHHIIIIHIi^^^^) Por example, in a July 2003 CIA briefing for White House officials

on the CIA interrogation program, the CIA represented that "[m]ajor threats were countered and
attacks averted," and that "[tjermination of this [CIA] program will result in loss of life, possibly
extensive." The CIA further represented that "the use of the [CIA's enhanced interrogation]
techniques has produced significant results" and "savedlives."^^^- Under the heading,
"RESULTS: MAJOR THREAT INFO," a briefing slides states:
"KSM: Al-Qa'ida Chief of Operations... - Identification of lyman Faris"^''^-^
Similarly, on Febmary 27, 2004, DDO James Pavitt responded to

the CIA Inspector General's draft Special Review and included a representation related to lyman
Faris. Pavitt stated that the Inspector General's Special Review should have come to the

"conclusion that our efforts have thwarted attacks and saved lives," and that "EITs (including the
water board) have been indispensable to our successes.Pavitt provided materials to the OIG
that stated:

^ review of CIA operational cables and other records found that

the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program and the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques
played no role in the identification and capture of lyman Faris.'^^^
CIA records indicate that lyman Paris was known to the U.S.
Intelligence Community prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001. On March
2001, the FBI

opened an international terrorism investigation targeting lyman Faris.^^^^ According to CIA
records, the "predication of the [FBI] Faris investigation was information provided by [foreign]
authorities that [revealed] Faris' telephone number had been called by Islamic extremists
operating in France, Belgium, Turkey and Canada," including "millennium bomber" Ahmad

Ressam.^^^^ Ressam, currently serving a 65-year U.S. prison term, was arrested on December
14, 1999, en route to Los Angeles International Airport with explosives in the trunk of his car.
According to CIA records, as "a result of a post 9/11 lead," the FBI interviewed lyman Faris
shortly after die attacks of September 11,2001.'^^'^ On November
2001, the FBI closed its
invesrigation of lyman Faris for unknown reasons.
Ori March 5, 2003, Majid Khan was taken into Pakistani

custody.That sam^ay^IS^co^age of Majid Khan's residence in Maryland indicated
that Majid Khan's
made a suspicious phone call to an individual at a
residence associated with lyman Faris.The call included discussion of Majid Khan's

possible arrest and potential FBI surveillance of^^^Hj^H, who asked the individual in Ohio

if he had been approached and questioned.^^^^^^^Bwarned the Ohio-based individual

not to contact anyone using his phone.

Thatsameday7^^^B||HB informed FBI special

agents that the other party to the intercepted conversation was lyman Faris.By March 6,
2003, the FBI had officially reopened its international terrorism investigation of lyman Faris.

The CIA's June 2013 Response acknowledges that "we incorrectly stated or implied that KSM's information
led to the investigation of Faris." Elsewhere, the CIA's June 2013 Response states that "[CIA] imprecisely
characterized KSM's information as having 'led' to the investigation of lyman Faris, rather than more accurately
characterizing it as a key contribution to the investigation." As described in more detail in Volume II, the CIA and

FBI had significant information on lyman Faris priorto any reporting from KSM. The CIA's June 2013 Response
also states that tlie CIA's inaccurate statements that KSM's reporting "led" to the investigation of lyraan Faris were
only made "[i]n a few cases," and "[ijn a small number of., representations." As described in the full Committee

Study, the CIA repeatedly represented that KSM's reporting "led" to the investigation of lyman Faris, and was
responsible for the "identification" and "capture" of lyman Faris.

While U.S. law enforcement investigations of lyman Paris moved
forward, Majid Khan, in foreign government custody, was being questioned by foreign
government interrogators. According to CIA records, the inteiTogators were using rapport-

building techniques, confronting Khan with inconsistencies in his story and obtaining
information on Majid Khan's al-Qa'ida connections.On March 11, 2003, Majid Khan
identified a photo of lyman Paris.Majid Khan stated that he knew Paris as "Abdul Raof,"
and claimed Paris was a 35-year-old truck driver of Pakistani origin who was a "business partner
of his father."
In addition to describing business deals lyman Paris was involved in witli
Khan's family, Majid Khan stated that Paris spoke Urdu and excellent English and had a
"colorful personality.The next day, while still in foreign government custody, Majid Khan

stated that lyman Paris was "an Islamic extremist."^According to CIA cables, on March 14,
2003, Majid Khan provided "more damning information" on lyman Paris, specifically that Paris
was a "mujahudden during the Afghan/Soviet period" and was a close associate of his uncle,
Maqsood Khan. Maqsood was a known al-Qa'ida associate whom Majid Khan had already
admitted was in contact with senior al-Qa'ida members. Majid Khan told foreign government

interrogators that it was Maqsood who provided the money for Majid Khan's al-Qa'ida-related
travels.Majid Khan further stated that "after the KSM arrest became public knowledge,"
lyman Paris contacted Majid Khan's family and requested the family pass a message to Maqsood

IGian regarding the status of KSM.'^^^ This information on lyman Paris was acquired prior toâ
and independently ofâany reporting from the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.
On March 10, 2003, in response to a requirements cable from CIA

Headquarters reporting that al-Qa'ida was targeting U.S. suspension bridges,^KSM stated that
any such plans were "theoretical" and only "on paper." He also stated that no one was currently

pursuing such a plot.^^^^ KSM repeated this assertion on March 16, 2003,'^^^ noting that, while
UBL officially endorsed attacks against suspension bridges in the United States, he "had no
planned targets in the US which were pending attack and that after 9/11 the US had become too

hard a target."^^^^ On neither occasion did KSM reference lyman Paris.
1582

13678 (070724Z MAR 03). The cable states: "a [foreign government officer] talked quietly to

[Majid Khan] alone for about ten minutes before the interview began and was able to establish an excellent level of
rapport. The first hour and [a] half of the interview was a review of bio-dataand information previously [reported].
When [foreign government interrogators] started putting pressure on [Majid Klian] by pulling apart his story about
his 'honeymoon' in Bangkok and his attempt to rent an apartment, safehouse, for his cousin [Mansoor Maqsood, aka
Iqbal, aka Talha, aka Moeen, aka Habib], at 1400, [Majid Klian] slumped in his chair and said he would reveal
everythingtoofficers.

|, who was reading the intelligence from the foreign government interrogations of Majid
Khan, requested a photograph of Majid Khan and additional information to use with KSM.^^^"^
In response, CIA Headquarters sent the detention site photographs of Majid Khan's family and
associates, including lyman Paris.

(Â¥S/4|||||^mi|||||^^^) On March 17, 2003, eleven days after the FBI officially reopened
its investigation of lyman Faris, KSM was shown photographs of both lyman Faris and Majid

Khan.'^^^ According to CIA cables, KSM was also asked detailed questions based on email
communications, which a cable stated served as "an effective means to convey to [KSM] the
impression that the USG already possessed considerable information and that the information
would be used to check the accuracy of his statements."In this context, KSM identified the
photograph of lyman Faris as a "tmck driver" and a relative of Majid Khan. KSM claimed that
he could not remember the truck driver's name. KSM described the "tmck driver" as a "colorful

character who liked to drink and have girlfriends and was very interested in business.The
next day, March 18, 2003, KSM stated that in February 2002 he tasked the "truck driver" to
procure specialized machine tools that would be useful to al-Qa'ida to loosen the nuts and bolts
of suspension bridges in the United States. According to KSM, in March 2002, the "truck

driver" asked Mansour Khan [son of Maqsood Khan]^^^^ to inform KSM that he (the "truck
driver") could not find such tools. KSM stated that he made no further requests of the "truck
driver."^^Â®Â®

According to a CIA cable, on the evening of March 20, 2003, the
FBI informed the CIA that "Ohio police had been following [lyman] Faris for 'some time,' and

6. The Identification, Capture, and Arrest ofSajid Badat
Summary: The CIA represented that its enhanced inteiTOgation

techniques were effective and produced critical, otherwise unavailable intelligence, which
thwarted plots and saved lives. Over a period of years, the CIA provided the identification,
discovery, capture, and arrest of Sajid Badat as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques. These representations were inaccurate. U.K. domestic
investigative efforts, reporting from foreign intelligence services, international law enforcement
efforts, and U.S. military reporting resulted in the identification and arrest of Sajid Badat.

"severely disappointed to leariUha^man had not yet been successful in his mission to purchase the necessary

told CIA interrogators that d-Qa'ida members had "cased" the Brooklyn Bridge and that KSM had discussed
attacking suspension bridges with other senior al-Qa'ida operatives. See HEADQUARTERS

Further Details: Sajid
was selected by al-Qa'ida leaders,
including Abu Hafs al-Masri and Sayf al-'Adl, to can-y out an attack against a Western airliner

with Richard Reid using a shoe bomb explosive device in December 2001.^^'^ Sajid Badat
returned to the United Kingdom in late 2001 and sent a message to his al-Qa'ida handler, Ammar

al-Baluchi, stating that he was withdrawing from the operation.^^^^ On December 22, 2001,
Note on CIA records related to U.K.-based "Issas": Two United Kingdom-based al-Qa'ida associates, Dhiren

Barot and Sajid Badat, were known by the same common aliases, Issa, Abu Issa, Abu Issa al-Britani ("[of] Britain")
and/or Issa al-Pakistanl. Botli individuals were British Indians who had been independently in contact witli senior
al-Qa'ida leaders in Pakistan. Reporting indicated that the Issas were located in the United Kingdom and engaged in
terrorist targeting of the U.K. The investigation into their true identities was a U.K.-led operation. As a result, the
CIA sometimes had limited insight into U.K.-based activities to identify and locate tlie Issas. Senior CIA personnel
expressed frustration that the U.K. was not sharing all known informationon its investigations, writing in August
2003 that "[the FBI is] clearly working closely with the [U.K. service] on diese matters and [the CIA is] at the
mercy" of what it is told. In June 2003, the CIA informed the FBI that tlie CIA had "no electronic record of
receiving any transcripts or summaries from your agency's interviews with [Richard] Reid, and would appreciate
dissemination of summaries of questioning for the purposes of [CIA] analysis." Until the arrest of one of the Issas,
Sajid Badat, on November 27, 2003, die U.S. Intelligence Community and U.K. authorities often confused the two
al-Qa'ida associates. As a result, the quality and clarity of detainee reporting on the Issas (including reporting from

detainees inthecustodyoft^^ U.S. militai-y, Department ofJustice, and foreign services) varied. CIA
personnel HIHHHIIHH reported in September 2003 that there were "two (or three) Abu Issas" in
intelligence reporting and that because of their similarities, it was often "unclear wliich Issa the detainees [were]
referring to at different stages." Once detained in the United Kingdom in November 2003, Sajid Badat (one of the
Issas) cooperated with U.K. authorities and provided information about die other "Issa." Badat stated that "people
often asked [Badat] about [the other] Issa, as they were both British Indians." According to Sajid Badat, "anyone
who had been involved witli jihad in Britain since the mid-90s" would know Issa al-Hindi (aka Dhiren Barot), to
include Babar Ahmed, Moazzem Begg, Richard Reid, Zacarias Moussaoui, and KSM. The other Issa, Dhiren Barot,
arrested on August 3, 2004, was found to have been especially well-known among the U.K.-based extremist
community, having written a popular book in 1999 expounding the virtues of jihad in Kashmir under the alias, "Esa
al-Hindi." CIA records include a reference to the book and a description of its author ("a brother from England who

was a Hindu and became a Muslim...[who^oUrainin^i^^hanistai^^^^^ail^s December 1999
(disseminated by the CIA on 12/31/99 in
[foreign pailner] would later
report tliat Dhiren Barot "frequently" appeared "in reporting of terrorist training" and had "involvement in Jihad in
occupied Kashmir, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Malaysia, tliroughout the 1990s." The Committee Study is based on
more than six million pages of material related to the CIA's Detention and Intenogation Program provided by the
CIA. Access was not provided to intelligence databases of tlie CIA or any other U.S. or foreign intelligence or law
enforcement agency. Insomuch as intelligence from these sources is included, it was, unless noted othei-wise, found
within the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program material produced for this Study. It is likely that significant
intelligence unrelated to the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program on Sajid Badat and Dhiren Barot exists in
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement records and databases. See intelligence clironology in Volume II, including:

review in Volume HI, KSM did discuss the two operatives, but he did not identify either by name (or, in the case of

the eventual identification of, or locational information for, either individual.

The discovery, identification, capture, and arrest ofSajid Badat,

"the shoe bomber," is one of the eight most frequently cited examples provided by the CIA as
evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. Over aperiod of
years, CIA documents prepared for and provided to senior policymakers, intelligence officials,
and the Department of Justice represent the discovery, identification, capture, and/or arrest of
Sajid Badat as an example of how "[kjey intelligence collected from HVD interrogations after
applying interroption techniques" had "enabled CIA to disrupt teiTorist plots" and "capture
addidonal ten-orists."^^'^ In at least one CIA document prepared for the president, the CIA
specifically highlighted the waterboard interrogation technique in enabling the CIA to learn "that
Sajid Badat was the operative slated to launch a simultaneous shoe bomb attack with Richard

Reid in 2001."'^^^ The CIA further represented that the intelligence acquired from the CIA's

enhanced interrogation techniques was "otherwise unavailable" and "saved lives."

From 2003 through 2009, tlie CIA's representations regarding the effectiveness ofthe CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques provided aspecific set of examples of ten'orist plots "disrupted" and terrorists captured that
the CIA attributed to information obtained from the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques. CIA
representations further asserted that the intelligence obtained from the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques was unique, otherwise unavailable, and resulted in "saved lives." Among other CIA representations, see:
(1) CIA representations in the Department ofJustice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum, dated May 30, 2005,
which relied on aseries of highly specific CIA representations on the type of intelligence acquired from the use of
the CU senhanced interrogation techniques to assess their legality. The CIA representations referenced by the
OLC include that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was "necessary" to obtain "critical,"
"vital," and "otherwise unavailable actionable intelligence" that was "essential" for tlie U.S. government to "detect

Similarly, in early March 2005, the CIA compiled talking points on

the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques for use in a meeting with the
National Security Council. The document states, "[t]he Central Intelligence Agency can advise
you that this program works and the techniques are effective in producing foreign intelligence."

certain "enhanced interrogation techniques" were consistent with United States obligations under
Article 16 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or
Degrading Treatment or Punishment.The CIA-provided document states:

body of intelligencecollected after the December 22, 2001, attempted shoe bomb attack by Richard Reid indicated
that the proposed partner"backed out of theoperation." This information wascorroborated by signals intelligence.
Once detained on November 27, 2003, Sajid Badat cooperated with U.K. authorities and described how he withdrew
from the operation. See, among other CIA records, CIA Headquarters document, entitled, "OPERATIONAL

Contrary to CIA representations, a review of CIA operational
cables and other documents found that the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques did not
result in otherwise unavailable intelligence leading to the discovery, identification, capture, or
arrest of Sajid Badat. According to CIA records and the U.K.'s own investigative summary,
the investigation of Sajid Badat was a United Kingdom-led operation, and the intelligence that
alerted security officials to: (1) a U.K.-based "Issa" (aka, Sajid Badat); (2) a potential second

"shoe bomber" related to Richard Reid;'^^^ (3) a suspected U.K. terrorist named "Sajid
Badat";(4) Sajid Badat's connectionto Richard Reid; (5) Sajid Badat's physical description;
(6) Sajid Badat's location; and (7) the initial identification of a U.K. surveillance photo of Sajid
Badat, the "shoe bomber,was unrelated to information acquired from CIA detainees during
or after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. CIA records indicate that the
information that led to Sajid Badat's arrest and U.K. criminal prosecution was also not derived
from the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.

Prior to any reporting from CIA detainees, and as early as January
14, 2002, the FBI informed the CIA that Richard Reid "had an unidentified partner who
allegedly backed out of the operation at the last minute."This information was later

"''^^â¢113165
The CIA's June 2013 Response maintains that "KSM was the first to tell [the CIA] there was a second shoe

bomber and that he remained at large." The Committee found this statement to be incongruent with CIA records.
There were multiple reports that Richard Reid had an unidentified partner prior to the provision of any information
from KSM (captured on March 1, 2003). The CIA's June 2013 Response addresses only one of two documented
efforts by the FBI in January 2002 to inform the CIA that Richard Reid had "an unidentified partner who allegedly
backed out of the operation at the last minute." The CIA's June 2013 Response acknowledges that this FBI
infomiation was provided to senior CIA leadership in writing, but states that, on one of the two days the information
was provided, "the Reid investigation came on page 10 of 15 pages of updates that day," and that the information
did not "exist in any searchable CIA data repositories." The CIA's June 2013 Response also does not address the
CIA's own source reporting on "another operative" who existed alongside Richard Reid. In April 2002, a reliable
CIA sourceâwho had warned of the Richard Reid shoe-bomb attack weeks before it occurredâreportedthat, in
addition to Richard Reid, "another operative existed." The source stated that, instead of an airliner departing from
Paris, as had Richard Reid's flight, "this attack would occur against an airliner originating from Heathrow
International Airport in London." Once captured, Sajid Badat would confirm this reporting. Despiteacknowledging
evidence to the contrary, and without further explanation, the CIA stated in meetings with the Committee in 2013
that the CIA stands by its representations that "KSM was the first to tell [the CIA] there was a second shoe bomber
and that he remainedat large."
See Volume II, including FBI WASHINGTON DC
(160429Z JUL 02). The CIA's June 2013
Response acknowledges that there was intelligence reporting that Sajid Badat was involved in terrorist activities and
"targeting American interests," but defends its past assertions highlighting the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced
inteiTOgation techniques in obtaining otherwise unavailable intelligence by asserting that, at the time of this
reporting, there "was nothing at the time on Badat to lead [the CIA] to prioritize him over others."

jj-,e CIA's June 2013 Response states: "KSM was the first person to provideâin March2003, after having

undergone enhanced inteiTogation techniques in CIA custodyâa detailed and authoritative narrative of al-Qa'ida
development of and plans to use shoe bombs operationally." The CIA's June 2013 Response does not acknowledge
intelligence acquired by the Intelligence Community on these matters prior to any reporting from KSM and does not
address the significant amount of fabricated reporting KSM provided. See Volume n for additional information.
See Volume 11 for additional information.

The FBI infonnation was provided to the CIA. See CIA Headquarters document, entitled, "OPERATIONAL
DEVELOPMENTS AGAINST GLOBAL SUNNI EXTREMIST TERRORISM," dated, "14 January 2002 1630
Hours." The CIA's June 2013 Response acknowledges the existence of this CIA document and that the information

in the document was "compiled... for counterterrorism seniors at CIA." The CIA's June 2013 Response nonedieless

cards recovered by the FBI from Richard Reid upon his arrest were used by an individual named

Sajid Badat to call a known terrorist, Nizar Trabelsi.^^^^ FBI interviews of Trabelsiâofficially
relayed to the CIA in July 2002âreported that "L. Badad Sajid" was "involved in operations

expressed concern that the FBI was not shaiing information from the debriefings of Richard Reid. Additional FBI
information about Sajid Badat, including anyinfoniiation obtained from Richard Reid, was not available to the
Committee. See CIA WASHINGTON DC

See intelligence chronology in Volume 11, including U.S. military detainee reporting detailed in CIA
Headquarters document, entitled, "OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS AGAINST GLOBAL SUNNI

CIA source who stated that, in addition to Richard Reid, "another operative existed" who was planning an attack

"against an airliner originating from Heathrow International Airport in London." Tlie same source had provided
reporting on an "attack... against an airliner originating in France, Germany, or Britain, with the use of explosives
concealed in shoes" just prior to Richard Reid's attempted use of explosives concealed in shoes on December 21,
2001. Despite corroborated intelligence reporting acquired prior to the provision of information from CIA
detainees, the CIA represented, as late as October 2007, that "[m]ost, if not all, of the intelligence acquired from
high-value detainees in [the CIA] program would likely not have been discovered or reported in any other way,"
crediting CIA detainees with "the discovery of an operative who was preparing another attack like that attempted by
'shoe bomber' Richard Reid." See CIA fax from CIA employee [REDACTED] to U.S. Senate Committee on

Issa's name."'^"^^ On August 22, 2003, emails among CIA officers stated that "CTC believes that

Summary: The CIA represented that its enhanced interrogation
techniques were effective and produced critical, otherwise unavailable intelligence, which
thwarted plots and saved lives. Over a period of years, the CIA provided the identification and
thwarting of the Heathrow Airport Plot as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques. These representations were inaccurate. A review of records indicates
that the Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf plotting had not progressed beyond the initial
planning stages when the operation was fully disrupted with the detentions of Ramzi bin alShibh, KSM, Ammar-al-Baluchi, and Khallad bin Attash. None of these individuals were
captured as a result of reporting obtained during or after the use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques against CIA detainees.
Further Details: After the September 11, 2001, attacks against the
United States, KSM sought to target the United Kingdom using hijacked aircraft and surmised
that Heathrow Airport and a building in Canary Wharf, a major business district in London, were

powerful economic symbols.^^^^ The initial planwas for al-Qa'ida operatives to hijackmultiple
airplanes departing Heathrow Airport, turn them around, and crash them into the airport itself.
Security was assessed to be too tight at Heathrow Airport and the plan was altered to focus on
aircrafts departing from mainly Eastern European airports to conduct attacks against Heathrow
Airport. Al-Qa'ida was unable to locate pilots to conduct these attacks.Once KSM was
detained in Pakistan on March 1, 2003, responsibility for the planning was passed to Ammar alBaluchi and Khallad bin Attash, who were at the time focused on caiTying out attacks against
Western interests in Karachi, Pakistan.

The thwarting of the Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf plotting
is one of the eight most frequently cited examples provided by the CIA as evidence for the
effectiveness of the CIA's enlianced interrogation techniques. Over a period of years, CIA
documents prepared for and provided to senior policymakers, intelligence officials, and the
Department of Justice represent the Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf plotting as an example
of how "[k]ey intelligence collected from HVD interrogations after applying interrogation

techniques" had "enabled CIA to disrupt terrorist plots" and "capture additional ten'orists."^^^^
The CIA further represented that the intelligence acquired from the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation

techniques was "otherwise unavailable" and "saved lives."^^^^
1663 \Yhile the CIA refers to "Canary Wharf' as a potential target of KSM's plotting, intelligence records suggest the
actual taiget was likely "One Canada Square," the tallest building in the United Kingdom at the time of the plotting,
which is located in Canary Whaif, a major business district in London.
See detailed intelligence clironology in Volume II.
See the Karachi Plots section in this summary, as well as additional details in Volume U.
Italics included in CIA Memorandum to the Office of Legal Counsel, entitled, "Effectiveness of the CIA
CounterteiTorist Interrogation Techniques," from March 2, 2005.

1667 pjoni 2003 through 2009, the CIA's representations regarding the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques provided a specific set of examples of terrorist plots "disrupted" and terrorists captured that
the CIA attributed to information obtained from the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques. CIA

representations further asserted that the intelligence obtained from the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques was unique, otherwise unavailable, and resulted in "saved lives." Among other CIA representations, see\
(1) CIA representations in tlie Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum, dated May 30, 2005,

explained in a letter to National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, Homeland Security Advisor
Frances Townsend, and Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte, that he was

"vital," and "otherwise unavailable actionable intelligence" that was "essential" for the U.S. governmentto "detect
and disrupt" terrorist threats. The OLC memorandum further states that "[the CIA] ha[s] informed [the OLCJ that
the CIA believes that this program is laigely responsible for preventing a subsequent attack within the United
States." (See Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, SeniorDeputy General Counsel,Central Intelligence Agency, from

Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum dated July 20, 2007, which also relied on CIA
representations on the type of intelligence acquired from the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.
Citing CIA documents and the President's September 6, 2006, speech describing the CIA's interrogation program
(which was based on CIA-provided information), the OLC memorandum states: "The CIA interrogation programâ
and, in particular, its use of enhanced interrogation techniquesâis intended to serve this paramount interest [security
of the nation] by producing substantial quantities of otherwise unavailable intelligence. ...As the President explained
[on September 6, 2006], 'by giving us information about tenorist plans we could not get anywhere else, the program
has saved innocent lives.'" (See Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel, Central Intelligence

"...only 29 [CIA detainees] have undergone an inteiTogation that used one or
more of the 13 [CIA enhanced interrogation] techniques.These

for Heathrow airport. I can inform you with confidence that this program has
allowed the U.S. to save hundreds, if not thousands, of lives
Similarly, the CIA infoiTned the CIA inspector general on
February 27, 2004, that:
"As a result of the lawful use of EITs, KSM also provided information on an

al-Qa'ida plotfor suicide airplane attacks outside of the United States that
would have killed thousands ofpeople in the United Kingdom. .. .Of note, even
after KSM reported that al-Qa'ida was planning to target Heathrow, he at first
repeatedly denied there was any other target than the airport. Only after the
repeated lawful use ofEITs did he stop lying and admit that the sketch of a

KSM the engineer drew himself in order to show another AQ operative that the

-or

to the detention and interrogation of the CIA detainees

credited by the CIA with providing information on the plot, the CIA and other intelligence
agencies were already "alerted" to al-Qa'ida's efforts to target Heathrow Airport. Specifically,
the CIA knew that: (1) KSM and al-Qa'ida were targeting "a national symbol in the United
Kingdom" and that this symbol was the "Heathrow airport";(2) the attack plan called for
hijacking commercial aircraft and crashing them directly into Heathrow airport;'^^"^ (3) no pilots
had been identified by al-Qa'ida and the planned attack was not imminent;^^^^ (4) KSM, Ammar
As described in this Study, the CIA consistently represented from 2003 tlirough 2009 that the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques resulted in "disrupted plots," listed the "Heathrow Plot" as disrupted "as a result
of the EITs," and informed policymakers that the information acquired to disrupt the plotting could not have been
obtained from other intelligence sources or methods available to the U.S. government. In at least one CIA
representation to White House officials that highlighted the Heathrow plotting, the CIA represented that "the use of
the [CIA's enhanced interrogation] tecliniques has produced significant results," and warned policymakers that
"[tjermination of this [CIA] program will result in loss of life, possibly extensive." The CIA's June 2013 Response
states: "CIA disagrees with the Study's assessment that [the CIA] inconectly represented that information derived
from interrogating detainees helped disrupt al-Qa'ida's targeting of Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf in London,
including in PresidentBush's 2006 speech on theProgram. Detainee reporting, including some which was acquired
after enhanced interrogationtechniques were applied, played a critical role in uncovering the plot, understanding it,
detaining many of the key players, and ultimately allowing us to conclude it had been disrupted. It is a complex
story, however, and we should have been clearer in delineating the roles played by different partners." As described
in this summaiy, past CIA representations concerning the Heathrow Airport plotting and intelligence acquired "as a
result of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were inaccurate. (See, among other records, the September
6, 2006, speech by President Bush, based on CIA information and vetted by the CIA, which describes the CIA's use
of "an alternative set" of interrogation procedures and stating: "These are some of the plots that have been stopped
because of the information of this vital program. Terrorists held in CIA custody...have helped stop a plot to hijack
passenger planes and fly tliem into Heathrow or Canaty Whaif in London.") Contrary to the CIA's June 2013
assertion, CIA records indicate that information related to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques
played no role in "detaining manyof the key players" and played no role in "uncovering tlie [Heathrow] plot." CIA
records indicate the Heathrow Airport plotting had not progressed beyond the initial planning stages when the
operation was fully disrapted with the detention of Ramzi bin al-Shibh (detained on September 11, 2002), KSM
(detained on March 1, 2003), Ammar-al-Baluchi (detained on April 29, 2003), and Khallad bin Attash (detained on
April 29, 2003). The CIA's June 2013 Response states that "[b]y all accounts, KSM's anest was the action that
most disrupted the [Heathrow] plot." As detailed in this summary and in greater detail in Volume II, the capture of
these detaineesâincluding KSMâwas unrelated to any reporting from CIA detainees. CIA records further indicate
that details on al-Qa'ida's targeting of Heathrow Airport were acquired prior to any reporting from CIA detainees.
For example, prior to receiving any information from CIA detainees, the CIA acquired detailed information about
al-Qa'ida's targeting of Heathrow Airport, to include, but not limited to, the al-Qa'ida senior leaders involved, the
method of the planned attack, the status of the operation, and the kiinyas of two potential unwittingoperatives in the
United Kingdom. Finally, the CIA's June 2013 Response claims tliat its past CIA representations were accurate and
that CIA "detainee reporting, including some which was acquired after enhanced interrogation techniques were
applied, played a critical role" in providing information, "ultimately allowing [CIA] to conclude it had been
disrupted." Prior to June 2013, the CIA had never represented that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques produced information "allowing [CIA] to conclude [the Heathrow Plot]had been disrupted." Rather, as
detailed in this summary and morefully in Volume II, the CIA represented that the information acquired "as a result
of EITs" produced unique, otherwise unavailable "actionableintelligence"that "saved lives" and disrupted the

plotting itself. Asdet^ed, these representations were inaccurate.

two operatives were unwitting of the plot;^^^^ and (6) KSM was seeking Saudi and British

Bulletin from March 2006 states: "the [Heathrow Airport] operation was disrupted mid-cycle,

around the spring of 2003, when several of the key plotters, including KSM, were detained."'^^"
Foreign government intelligence analysis came to the same conclusion.
While each of these four detainees provided information on the

plotting during their detentions, none of this information played any role in the disruption of the
plot. A wide body of intelligence reporting indicated that no operatives were informed of the

See section of this summary and Volume II on the "Capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh." The CIA's June 2013
Response states that "the information provided by Abu Zubaydah played a key role in the capture of Ramzi Bin alSliibh." As described in the "Capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh" in this summary and in greater detail in Volume II,
Ramzi bin al-Shibh was not captured as a result of information acquired during or after the use of the CIA's
enhanced intenogation techniques against Abu Zubaydah.

June 2013 Response acknowledges that "[b]y all accounts, KSM's anest was the action that most disrupted tlie

plot, no pilots were ever identified by al-Qa'ida for the attacks, and only schedules of potential
flights were collected for review.

CIA detainee records indicate that reporting from CIA detainees on
aspects of the Heathrow plotting was often unreliable and not believed by CIA officers. For
example, KSM retracted information he provided while being subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques, including information linking Jaffar al-Tayyarto the Heathrow Plot.'^^^
On May 20, 2003, nearly two months after the CIA ceased using its enhanced interrogation
techniques against KSM, a CIA analyst wrote that KSM had provided tiiree different stories
related to the Heathrow plotting, writing to CIA colleagues: "Bottom Line: KSM knows more

about this plot than he's letting on."^^^^ By late June 2004, KSM had retracted much of the
varied reporting he had provided on the Heathrow plotting, most importantly the information
KSM provided on tasking potential operatives to obtain flight training.
KSM stated that
during March 2003âwhen he was being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniquesâ"he may have given false information," and that, in many cases, the information he
provided was "just speculation.The value of other CIA detainee reporting was also
questioned by CIA officers.In July 2003, a cable from the CIA's ALEC Station stated that

"HQS/ALEC remains concerned with what we believe to be paltry information coming from
detainees about operations in the U.K."^^^Â®
In addition, KSM withheld information Hnking Abu Taiha alPakistani to the Heathrow plotting. According to CIA interrogation records, KSM discussed
Canary Wharf the first time he was shown his notebook, in which the words "Canary Wharf'
were written.KSM stated, however, that he had drawn the sketch for Ammar al-Baluchi. In

8. The Capture of Hambali

Summary: The CIA represented that its enhanced interrogation
techniques were effective and produced critical, otherwise unavailable intelligence, which
thwarted plots and saved lives. Over a period of years, the CIA provided the capture of Hambali
as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques. Specifically,

the CIA consistently represented that, as a result of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques,
KSM provided the "first" information on a money transfer by Majid Khan that eventually led to
Hambali's capture. These CIA representations were inaccurate. Majid Khan, who was in
foreign government custody, provided this information prior to any reporting from KSM. CIA
records indicate that the intelligence that led to Hambali's capture in Thailand was based on
signals intelligence, a CIA source, and Thai investigative activities.

The CIA's June 2013 Response asserts that Abu Talha was "the individual managing the [Heathrow]
plot." Contrary to CIA assertions, CIA records indicate tliatAbu Talha served as an assistant to Ammar al-Baluchi
and KSM and played no leadership or managerial role in the plotting. KSM reported that Abu Talha's "primary
skill [was] his ability to gather infonnation," and that Abu Talha would not have been able to take over the
Heathrow plotting after the arrest of Ammar al-Baluchi and Khallad bin Attash, "stress[ing] that Talha was not well
trained or particularly well connected to al-Qa'ida," did not know all of the components of the Heatlirow plotting,
and had no links to the unwitting Saudi operatives KSM was considering using in the plotting. KSM stated that after
the arrest of Ammar al-Baluchi and Khallad bin Attash, Abu Talha "would have known that the plot was

compromised and over." (See HIB 12141 (272231Z JUN 03);

20525 (141731Z FEB 04). For

additional infonnation on the two potential Saudi Arabia-based operatives, Ayyub and Azmari, who were
investigative targets of a foreign government prior to detainee reporting, unwitting of the Heathrow plotting, and
assessed by tlie CIA to have been killed or detained as a result of terrorist activity unrelated to the aforementioned
plotting, see Volume 11.). The CIA's June 2013 Response further states that "CIA lacked reporting on Abu Talha
prior to March 2003 and first learned of his specific role in the plot from debriefing KSM." A review of CIA
records found that on March 6, 2003, prior to any reporting from KSM or any other CIA detainee, Majid Khan, in
foreign government custody, discussed Ammar al-Baluchi's Karachi-based assistant, "Talha." Majid Klian provided
a phone number for Talha, and used that number at the request of his captors in an effort to locate and capture

Ammar al-Baluchi through Talha. (See H|||||HHl3678 (070724Z MAR 03); ||^H^HU3710 (081218Z MAR

P'urther Details: Ridiian bin Isomuddin, aka Hambali, was a senior

member of Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), a Southeast Asia-based teiTorist group, and served as an

interface between the JI and al-Qa'ida. Hambali was linked to terrorist activity prior to the
September 11, 2001, attacks. Shortly after those attacks, Hambali was described as the CIA's

"number one target" in Southeast Asia.^^^^ When the October 12, 2002, terrorist attacks
occurred on the Indonesian island of Bali, killing more than 200 individuals, Hambali was
immediately suspected of being the "mastermind" of the attacks and was further described as
"one of the world's most wanted ten-orists."'^^'^

The capture of Hambali is one of the eight most frequently cited
examples provided by the CIA as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques. Overa period of years, CIA documents prepared for and provided to
seniorpolicymakers, intelligence officials, and the Department of Justice represent the capture of
Hambali as an example of how "[k]ey intelligence collected from HVD interrogations after
applying interrogation techniques" had "enabled CIA to dismpt teiTorist plots" and "capture
additional terrorists.The CIA further represented that the intelligence acquired from the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was "othei-wise unavailable" and "saved lives."^^'-^^

effectiveness of individual interrogation techniques is difficult," but provides 11 specific
examples of "Key IntelligenceCollected from HVD Interrogations," including:

"Hambali's Capture: During KSM's interrogation we acquired information
that led to the capture of Hambali in August 2003 and to the partial
dismantling of the Jemaah Islamiyah leadershipin SE Asia. KSMfirst told us
about Majid Khan's role in delivering $50,000 to Hambali operatives for an
attack KSM believed was imminent. We then confronted Khan with KSM's

admission and [signals intelligence] confirming the money transfer and Khan's
travel to Bangkok. Khan admitted he delivered the money to an operative
named 'Zubair,' whom we subsequently identified and captured. Zubair's
capture led to the identification and subsequentcapture of an operative named
al Qaeda Detainees.) (3) CIA briefings for members of the National Security Council in July and September 2003
represented that "the use of Enhanced Techniques of one kind or another hadproduced significant intelligence
information that had, in the view of CIAprofessionals, saved lives," and warned policymakers that "[tjermination of
tliis program will result in loss of life, possibly extensive." {See August 5, 2003 Memorandum for the Record from

CIA's response to the Office of Inspector General draft Special Review of the CIA program, which asserts:
"Information [the CIA] received... as a result of the lawful use of enhanced inteiTOgation techniques ('EITs') has
almost certainly savedcountless American lives inside the United States and abroad. The evidence pointsclearlyto
the fact that witliout the use of such techniques, we and our allies would [have] suffered major terrorist attacks

Director Leon Panetta in February2009, which state that the "CIA assesses that the RDI program worked and the

[enhanced interrogation] techniques were effective in producing foreign intelligence," and that "[m]ost, if not all,of
the timely intelligence acquired from detainees in thisprogram would not have been discovered or reported by other
means." (See CIA briefing documents for Leon Panetta, entitled, "Tab 9: DCIA Briefing on RDI Program18FEB.2009" and grapliic attacliment, "Key Intelligence and Reporting Derived from Abu Zubaydahand Khalid

Similarly, on July 13, 2004, the CIA disseminated an Intelligence
Assessment entitled, "Khalid Shaykh Muhammad: Preeminent Source on Al-Qa'ida."'^^^ On

Apn^2^005, the paper, as well as other materials on CIA detainee reporting, was faxed from
I^HHcTC Legal, to the Office ofLegal Counsel atthe Department ofJustice, to support
the OLC's legal review of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniquesThe document
states:

"...information that KSM provided on Majid Khan in the spring of 2003
was the crucialfirst link in the chain that led us to the capture of
prominent JI leader and al-Qa'ida associate Hambali in August 2003,
and more than a dozen Southeast Asian operatives slated for attacks
against the US homeland. KSM told us about [Majid] Khan's role in
delivering $50,000 in December 2002 to operatives associated with
Hambali. ... [Majid] Khanâwho had been detained in Pakistan in early
2003âwas confronted with KSM's information about the money and
acknowledged that he delivered the money to an operative named
'Zubair.' .. .Based on that information, Zubair was captured in June
2003.â¢

On August 24, 2009, this document was declassified with redactions and publicly released with
the inaccurate information unredacted.^^Â®^

The CIA provided similar inaccurate representations regarding the
capture of Hambali in 18 of the 20 documents provided to policymakers and the Department of
1698

added. See May 2, 2006, Briefingfor Chief of Staff to the PresidentJosh Bolten: CIA Rendition,

Detention and Interrogation Programs. The CIA's June 2013 Response maintains that the chronology in tliis passage
and similar representations are correct. The CIA's June 2013 Response describes the following as "standard
language" and the CIA's "typical representation" of Hambali's capture: "KSM provided information about an alQa'ida operative, Majid Khan, who he was aware had recently been captured. KSMâpossibly believing the
detained operatives was 'talking' admitted to having tasked Majid with delivering a large sum of money to
individuals working for another senior al-Qa'ida associate. In an example of how information from one detainee
can be used in debriefing another detainee in a 'building block' process. Khanâconfronted with KSM's information
about the moneyâacknowledged that he delivered the money to an operative named Zubair and provided Zubair's
physical description and contact number" (italics added). The CIA's June 2013 Response states that this
chronology is "accurate." As detailed in this summary, and in greater detail in Volume II, this June 2013 CIA
representation is inaccurate. Majid Khanâwho was in foreign government custodyâfirst provided information on
the money exchange and Zubair, prior to any reporting from KSM.

Justice between July 2003 and March 2009.^^Â®^ In these representations, the CIA consistently
asserted that "after applying" the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, KSM provided "the

crucialfirst link" that led to the capture of HambaliJ^^

(TS^IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII^I^^F) Areview ofCIA operational cables and other records found that
information obtained from KSM during and after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques played no role in the capture of Hambali. A review of CIA records further found that
prior to reporting from CIA detainees subjected to the CIA's enhanced inten'ogation techniques,
the CIA had intelligence on: (1) Hambali's role in the Jemaah Islamiyah; (2) funding by alQa'ida and KSM of Hambali's terrorist activities; (3) the operative to whom Majid Khan
delivered the money, Zubair, and Zubair's links to terrorism, Jemaah Islamiyah, and Hambali;

and (4) Majid Khan's $50,000 money transfer from al-Qa'ida to Zubair in December 2002. CIA
records indicate that the intelligence that led to Hambali's capture was based on signals
intelligence, a CIA source, and Thai investigative activities in Thailand.
Prior to his capture, Hambali was known to have played a
supporting role in the KSM and Ramzi Yousef "Bojinka Plot," an effort in early 1995 to place
explosives on 12 United States-flagged aircraft and destroy them mid-flight.By the end of
2001, Hambali was suspected of playing a supporting role in the September 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks, as well as helping to enroll Zacai-ias Moussaoui in flight school.By early 2002, a
body of intelligence reporting unrelated to the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program
indicated that KSM was providing Hambali with funding to conduct terrorist operations in

Southeast Asia.'^Â®^ In March 2002, Hambali was described as the CIA's "number one target" in

Southeast Asia.^^^^ That same month, the FBI provided information to the CIA stating that
foreign government detainee reporting indicated that KSM reimbursed terrorism-related
expenditures made by Hambali for the
June of 2002, the CIA had entered into

discussions with representatives of the
government regarding their willingness to
accept custody of Hambali once he was captured.On September 25, 2002, the CIA reported
that an individual in FBI custody since May 2002, Mohammed Mansour Jabarah, reported that in

November 2001, he collected $50,000 from KSM for a Hambali-directed terrorist operation
targeting U.S. interests, as well as at least one other $10,000 payment.On the same day,
September 25, 2002, a CIA cable stated that Masran bin Arshad, while in the custody of a
foreign government, had detailed his connections to Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti and KSM.^^'^
According to bin Arshad, after KSM's "Second Wave" plotting was "abandoned" in late 2001,
bin Arshad was tasked by KSM to meet with Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in Pakistan and to deliver

$50,000 to HambaH for terrorist operations. Bin Arshad stated he was unable to deliver the
money.When the October 12, 2002, terrorist attacks occurred on the Indonesian island of

Bali, killing more than 200 individuals, Hambali was immediately suspected of being the
"mastermind" of the attacks and was further described as "one of the world's most wanted

terrorists.Open source information in October 2002 identified the funding for the Bali
bombings as flowing through Hambali from al-Qa'ida leadership in Pakistan. Through
November 2002, news reports highlighted link;s between senior al-Qa'ida leadershipâincluding
KSMâand JI in the context of the Bali bombings. Hambali continued to be identified as a
potential mastermind of the bombing and likely residing in Thailand. These same reports
identified a Malaysian named "Zubair" as one of three individuals sought by security officials for
the Hambali-linked Bali bombings.
In early January 2003, coverage of a known al-Qa'ida email
account uncovered communications between that account and the account of a former Baltimore,
Maryland, resident, Majid Khan. The communications indicated that Majid Khan traveled to
Bangkok, Thailand, in December 2002 for terrorist support activities and was in contact there

The CIA's June 2013 Response acknowledges that the CIA "had some other information linking Zubair to alQa'ida's Southeast Asia network," but states "that it was KSM's information that caused us to focus on [Zubair] as
an inroad to Hambali." The CIA's June 2013 Response further asserts: "KSM provided infonnation on an al-

Qa'ida operative named Zubair, we shared this information with Thai authorities, they detained Zubair, and he gave
actionable intelligence information that helped us identify Hambali's location." Tliis statement in the CIA's June
2013 Response is inaccurate. On October25, 2013, the CIA acknowledged the inaccuracy. Confirming information
in the Committee Study, the CIA stated that an additional review of CIA records by the CIA found that "No, KSM
did not name Zubair in his debriefings."

In May 2002, prior to the application of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, Abu Zubaydah identified
"Zubair" as a Malaysian national who was associated with KSM and who could be used by KSM to conduct attacks
in Thailand. According to Abu Zubaydah, Zubair also "assisted Abu Zubaydah in obtainmgpassportsfrom a printer

facility in eitlier Thailand or Malaysia." {See DIRECTOR jjj^H (271937Z MAY 02)||||||[||||^^

June 2002, Abu Zubaydah told an FBI interrogator that he sent a Canadian who sought to "help defend Muslims" in

than several of the cases the autliors chose to include." This is inaccurate. The CIA's June 2013 Response provided
three examples: the "Gulf shipping plot" (which is addressed in tlie full Committee Study and in this summary in the
context of the interrogation of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri), "learning important infomiation about al-Qa'ida's anthrax
plotting and the role of Yazid Sufaat" (which is addressed in the full Committee Study and in this summary in the
context of the interrogation of KSM), and "the detention of Abu Talha al-Pakistani" (wliich is addressed in the full

and the Capture of Dhiren Barot, aka Issa al-Hindi.").

1. The Identification of Khalid Shaykh Mohammad (KSM) as the Mastennind of the
September 11, 2001, Attacks

The CIA represented that CIA detainee Abu Zubaydah provided
"important" and "vital" information by identifying Khalid Shaykh Mohammed (KSM) as the
mastermind behind the attacks of September 11, 200CIA Director Hayden told the
Committee on April 12, 2007, that:

..it was Abu Zubaydah, early in his detention, who identified KSM as the
mastermind of 9/11. Until that time, KSM did not even appear in our chart of
key al-Qa'ida members and associates."^^"^^
at least two prominent occasions, the CIA represented,
inaccurately, that Abu Zubaydah provided this information after the use of the CIA's enhanced
inten-ogation techniques. On May 30, 2005, the Office of Legal Counsel wrote in a nowdeclassified memorandum:

"Inten'ogations of [Abu] Zubaydahâagain, once enhanced interrogation
techniques were employedâfurnished detailed information regarding al
Qaeda's 'organization structure, key operatives, and modus operandi' and
identified KSM as the mastermind of the September 11 attacks."

For example, in the September 6, 2006, speech validated by the CIA, President George W. Bush stated that:
"[Abu] Zubaydah disclosed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, or KSM, was the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks and

used the alias Mukhtar. This was a vital piece of the puzzle that helped our intelligence community pursue KSM."

The OLC memorandum cited a document provided by the CIA to
support the statement.The OLC memorandum further stated that the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques provide the U.S. goverrunent with "otherwise unavailable actionable
intelligence," that "ordinary inten-ogation techniques had little effect on...Zubaydah," and that
the CIA had "reviewed and confirmed the accuracy of [the OLC's] description of the

interrogation program, including its purposes, methods, limitations, and results."^^"^^
November 2007, the CIA prepared a set of documents and

talking points for the CIA director to use in a briefing with the president on the effectiveness of
the CIA's waterboard inten'ogation technique. The documents prepared assert that Abu
Zubaydah identified KSM as the "mastermind" of the September II, 2001, attacks after the use
of the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques.

While Abu Zubaydah did provide information on KSM's role in
the September 11, 2001, attacks, this information was corroborative of information akeady in
CIA databases and was obtained prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques.
There is no evidence to support the statement that Abu Zubaydah's informationâobtained by
FBI interrogators prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and while Abu
Zubaydah was hospitalizedâwas uniquely important in the identification of KSM as the
"mastermind" of the 9/11 attacks.

(U) The following describes information available to the CIA prior to the capture of Abu
Zubaydah:

(U) Both the Congressional Joint Inquiry Into the Intelligence Community Activities
Before and After the Ten'orist Attacks of September 11, 2001, and the CIA Office of the
Inspector General Report on CIA Accountability With Respect to the 9/11 Attacks
include lengthy chronologies of the Intelligence Community's interest in KSM prior to
the attacks of September 11, 2001. The timelines begin in 1995, when the United States
determined that KSM was linked to the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center,
leading to the determination by the National Security Council's Policy Coordination

See CIA Briefing Notes on the Value of Detainee Reporting, faxed to the OLC in April 2005. The "Briefing
Notes" state: "Within months of his anest, Abu Zubaydah provided details about al-Qa'ida's organization structure,

key operatives, and modus operandi. It also was Abu Zubaydah, early in his detention, who identified KSM as the
mastermind of 9/11." As described in detail in Volume II, tliis CIA document did not specifically reference the
CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques; however, it was provided to the OLC to support the OLC's legal analysis
of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. The document included most of the same examples the CIA had
previously provided as examples of the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. There are no
records to indicate that tlie CIA, in reviewing draft versions of the OLC memorandum, sought to correct the
inaccurate OLC statements.

CIA reporting in 1998 that KSM was "very close" to
On June 12, 2001, it was
reported that "Khaled" was actively recruiting people to travel outside Afghanistan,
including to the United States wherecolleagues were reportedly already in the country to

Commission Report, the CIA presumed this "Khaled" was KSMJ^^"^
On September 12, 2001, a foreign government source,
described as a member of al-Qa'ida, stated "the 11 September attacks had been
masterminded from Kabul by three people," to include "Shaykh Khalid," who was related
to Ramzi Yousef.^^^^

Also on September 12, 2001, a CIA officer familiar with

KSM wrote a cable stating that "[o]ne of the individuals who has the capability to
organize the kind of strikes we saw in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon is Khahd
Shaykh Mohammad."
On September 15, 2001, a CIA officer wrote to a number of

senior CTC officers, "I would say the percentages are pretty high that Khalid Sheikh
Mohammad is involved [in the September 11, 2001, attacks].
On October 16, 2001, an email from a CTC officer who had

been tracking KSM since 1997, stated that although more proof was needed, "I believe
KSM may have been the mastermind behind the 9-11 attacks.

information was provided by Abu Zubaydah to FBI interrogators prior to the initiation of the

3. The Capture ofRamzi bin al-Shibh

The CIA has represented that information acquired from CIA

detainee Abu Zubaydah, as a result of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, led to the
capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh. This CIA representation was included in President Bush's
September 6, 2006, speech on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. The speech,
which was based on CIA information and vetted by the CIA, stated that the intelligence provided
by CIA detainees "cannot be found any other place," and that the nation's "security depends on

getting this kind of inforraation."^^^^ The speech included the following:
"Zubaydah was questioned using these procedures [the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques], and soon he began to provide information on key alQa'ida operatives, including information that helped us find and capture more
of those responsible for the attacks on September the 1
example,
Zubaydah identified one of KSM's accomplices in the 9/11 attacks, a terrorist
named Ramzi bin al-Shibh. The infonnation Zubaydah provided helped lead
to the capture of bin al-Shibh. And togetlier these two terrorists provided
information that helped in the planning and execution of the operation that
captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

While the speech provided no additional detail on the capture of
bin al-Shibh, an internal email among senior CIA personnel provided additional background for
Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacksof September 11, 2001 (DTS #2005-3477), p. 112.) The CIA's
June 2013 Response states that "[w]e continue to assess that Abu Zubaydah's information was a critical piece of
intelligence." The CIA's June 2013 Response acknowledges the August 28, 2001, cable identifying KSM as
"Mukhtar," but states tliat CIA officers "overlooked" and "simply missed" tlie cable.

Italics added. As described in this summary and in the Abu Zubaydah detainee review in Volume 111, this
statement was inaccurate. Abu Zubaydah provided information on al-Qa'ida activities, plans, capabilities, and
relationships, in addition to information on its leadership structure, including personalities, decision-making
processes, training, and tactics prior to, during, and after the utilization of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques. Abu Zubaydah's inability to provide information on the next attack in the United States and operatives
in the United States was the basis for CIA representations that Abu Zubaydah was "uncooperative" and the CIA's
determination that Abu Zubaydah required the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques to become
"compliant" and reveal the information the CIA believed he was withholdingâthe names of operatives in the
United States or information to stop the next terrorist attack. At no point during or after the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques did Abu Zubaydah provide this type of information.

example of the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. After the speech,

Department in CTC, |^H^HH^|^|^ent an email to the chief of
|H|jj^|CTC LegalT^^^^^^^^I, and two

CIA Office of Public Affairs, among others. The email addressed press speculation that the
intelligence successes attributed to CIA detainees and the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques in the president's speech were not accurate. Defending the accuracy of the speech,
the chief of the
Department in CTC wrote: "The NY Times has posted a story
predictably poking holes in the President's speech." Regarding the CIA assertion that Abu
Zubaydah provided information after the use of the CIA's enhanced inten'ogation techniques that
led to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, the chief explained:
"...we knew Ramzi bin al-Shibh was involved in 9/11 before AZ was captured;

however, AZ gave us information on his recent activities that -when added
into other informationâhelped us track him. Again, on this point, we were

very careful and the speech is accurate in what it says about bin al-Shibh."^^^^
In addition, on February 17, 2007, the deputy chief of the
Department in CTC,
testified to the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence that Abu Zubaydah "led us to Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who in kind of [sic] started the

chain of events" that led to the capture of KSIVI.^^^'

Mazzetti, entitled, "Questions Raised About Bush's Primary Claims of Secret Detention System" inckided
comments by CIA officials defending the assertions in the President's speech: "Mr. Bush described the
interrogation techniques used on the C.I.A. prisoners as having been 'safe, lawful and effective,' and he asserted that
torture had not been used. .. .Mr. Bush also said it was the interrogation of Mr. Zubaydah that identified Mr. bin alShibh as an accomplice in the Sept. 11 attacks. American officials had identified Mr. bin al-Shibh's role in the
attacks months before Mr. Zubaydah's capture. A December 2001 federal grand jury indictment of Zacarias
Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker, said that Mr. Moussaoui had received money from Mr. bin al-Shibh and that
Mr. bin al-Shibh had shared an apartment with Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the plot. A C.I. A. spokesman said
Thursday [September 7, 2006] that the agency had vetted the president's speech and stood by its accuracy. ...[CIA]
spokesman, Paul Gimigliano, said in a statement... 'Abu Zubaydah not only identified Ramzi Bin al-Shibh as a 9/11
accomplice â something that had been done before â he provided information that helped lead to his capture."
For additional news accounts on this subject, see former CIA Director Michael Hayden's interview with tlie New
York Times in 2009, in which former Director Hayden "disputed an article in the New York Times on Saturday
[4/18/2009] tliat said Abu Zubaydali had revealed nothing new after being waterboarded, saying that he believed that
after unspecified 'techniques' were used, Abu Zubaydah revealed information that led to the capture of another

^ review of CIA records found no connection between Abu

Zubaydah's reporting on Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Ramzi bin al-Shibh's capture. CIA records

indicate that Ramzi bii^^hibl^a^aptured unexpectedlyâon September 11, 2002, when
Pakistani authorities,

were conducting raids targeting Hassan Ghul in

Pakistan.

While CIA records indicate that Abu Zubaydah provided
information on Ramzi bin al-Shibh, there is no indication in CIA records that Abu Zubaydah
provided information on bin al-Shibh's whereabouts. Further, while Abu Zubaydah provided
information on bin al-Shibh while being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques, he provided similar information to FBI special agents prior to the initiation of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.Prior to the application of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques, during interrogation sessions on May 19, 2003, and May 20, 2003, Abu
Zubaydah reviewed photographs of individuals known by his interrogators to be associated with
safehouses, which he shaied with us as a result of the use ofEITs, for example, played a key role in the ultimate

capture of Ramzi Bin al-Shibh" (italics added).

See additional information below, as well as the Abu Zubaydah detainee review in Volume III, and Federal
Bureau of Investigation documents pertaining "to the interrogation of detainee Zayn A1 Abideen Abu Zabaidah"
provided to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence by cover letter dated July 20, 2010 (DTS# 2010-2939).
The CIA's June 2013 Response includes the following: "...the Study states that Abu Zubaydah 'provided similar

information to FBI interrogators prior to the initiation of the CIA's enhancedinterrogation techniques.' This is
incorrect. Abu Zubaydah's unique information conceiTiing his contact with Hassan Gul was collected on 20 August
2002, after he had been subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques." This assertion in the CIA's June 2013
Response contains several enors: First, as described, the statement in the December 13, 2012, Committee Study
pertains to Abu Zubaydah's reporting on Ramzi bin al-Shibh, not Hassan Ghul. As detailed in this summary and in
other areas of tlie full Committee Study, while Abu Zubaydah provided information on Ramzi bin al-Shibh after the
use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, he provided similar information on bin al-Shibh to FBI
interrogators prior to the use and approval of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. Second, as detailed in
the full Committee Study, Abu Zubaydah provided considerable infomiation on Hassan Ghul prior to the use of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. (Some of this reporting has been declassified; for example, see the 9/11
Commission Report, specifically the Staff Report, "9/11 and Terrorist Travel," which highlights reporting by Abu
Zubaydah on Hassan Ghul that was disseminated by the CIA on June 20, 2002.) Third, in referencing information
that Abu Zubaydah provided on Hassan Ghul on August 20, 2002, the CIA's June 2013 Response asserts that this

was "unique information." The CIA's June 201^Respons^tates^|AbuZubaydal^tated^ ifhe personally

ultimately led them to an apartment linked to Gul." The CIA's June 2013 Response adds that the "unique
information concerning his contact with Hassan Gul was collected on 20 August 2002, after [Abu Zubaydah] had
been subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques." CIA records indicate, however, tliat the information

describedin the CIA's Response was not unique. Pakistani authorities had raided the home and interviewed B
[the same well-known associate] more than a month earlier on July 2002, based on similar reporting
from a cooperating detainee in foreign government custody. The CIA had specific and detailed knowledge of this

raid and the resultin^nter^w of
contac^v^

t^he well-known associate]. Pakistani authorities remained in

[the well-known associate], theprimary person interviewed, who was cooperative and

sent mil to help Pakistani authorities identify a possible al-Qa'ida safe houseâwhich the CIA noted was
"extremely close to (if not an exact match)" for a safe house the FBI connected KSM to weeks earlier on June 18,
2002.

the bombing of the USS Cole, as well as the September 11, 2001, attacks. Abu Zubaydah
identified a picture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh as "al-Shiba" and "noted that he is always with"
Another record of this interrogation stated that showing Abu Zubaydah the photos:
"was done to gauge his willingness to cooperate and provide details about
people, the last times he saw them, where they were going, etc. He appeared to
be very cooperative, provided details on people that we expected him to know,
the collective groups when they departed Afghanistan, where he thinks they

may now be, etc."^^^^
Shortly thereafter, on June 2, 2002, an FBI special agent showed

Abu Zubaydah the FBI "PENTTBOM photobook"^^^^ which contained photographs numbered 135. A cable states that Abu Zubaydah was volunteering information and was "forthcoming and
respond[ing] directly to questioning." Abu Zubaydah, who was not asked any "prepai'atory
questions regarding these photographs," identified photograph #31, known to the interrogators as
Ramzi bin al-Shibh, as a man he knew as al-Shiba, and stated al-Shiba was with KSM in

Qandahar circa December 2001. Abu Zubaydah stated that al-Shiba spoke Arabic like a Yemeni
and noted that al-Shiba was in the media after the September 11, 2001, attacks.

In early June 2002, Abu Zubaydah's interrogators recommended
that Abu Zubaydah spend several weeks in isolation while the interrogation team members

traveled |m| "as a means ofkeeping [Abu Zubaydah] off-balance and to allow the team needed
time off for a break and to attendto^rsonal matters
as well as to discuss "the
endgame" of Abu Zubaydah
with officers from CIA Headquarters.As a result, on
June 18, 2002, Abu Zubaydah was placed in isolation.Abu Zubaydah spent the remainder of

June 2002 and all ofJuly 2002, 47 days in total, in solitary detentior^ithou^e^^
questions. During this period, Abu Zubaydah's interrogators

FBI special agents never returned to the detention site.^^^^
When CIA officers next interrogated Abu Zubaydah, on August 4,

2002, they immediately used the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah,

including the waterboard.^^^' On August 21, 2002, while Abu Zubaydah was still being

was shown several photographs and "immediately recognized the photograph of Ramzi bin alShibh.
Abu Zubaydah described bin al-Shibh as having "very dark, almost African looking"
sJdn and noted that he first met bin al-Shibh after the 9/11 attacks in Kandahar, but added that he

"did not have in-depth conversations with him."^^^^ A cable stated that, after being shown the
photograph of bin al-Shibh, Abu Zubaydah told interrogators that he was told bin al-Shibh stayed
at the same safe house that KSM "had established for the pilots and others destined to be
involved in the 9/11 attacks.An accompanying intelligence cable stated that Abu Zubaydah
informed interrogators that he did not knowâand did not askâwhether bin al-Shibh had been
involved in the attacks of September 11, 2001, but did state that he believed that bin al-Shibh
was "one of the operatives working for Mukhtar aka Khaiid Shaykh Mohammad."

The information Abu Zubaydah provided while being subjected to
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was described by CIA interrogators as "significant
new details.However, the information provided by Abu Zubaydah was similar to
information Abu Zubaydah provided prior to the application of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques, or was otherwise already known to the CIA. CIA records indicate that as early as
September 15, 2001, Ramzi bin al-Shibh was identified as an associate of the September 11,
2001, hijackers who attempted to obtain flight training in Florida.A July 27, 2002, cable
from the CIA's ALEC Station provided "background information" on bin al-Shibh and stated
that he was "suspected of being the original '20th hijacker,' whose participation in the 11
September attacks was thwarted by his inability to obtain a visa to enter the United States."
Ramzi bin al-Shibh was also identified as "a member of the Hamburg cell that included hijacker
Mohammed Atta,"^^^^ and bin al-Shibh was featured in one of "five suicide testimonial videos
found in December 2001 at the residence of former UBL [Usama bin Ladin] lieutenant

Mohammad Atef in Afghanistan."^^^^
None of the above information resulted in Ramzi bin al-Shibh's

capture. As detailed below, Ramzi bin al-Shibh was captured unexpectedly during raids in
Pakistan on September 11, 2002, targeting Hassan Ghul.'^^^
Prior to Abu Zubaydah's capture, the CIA considered Hassan Ghul
a "First Priority Raid Target," based on reporting that:

"Ghul has been a major support player within the al-Qa'ida network and has
assisted al-Qa'ida and Mujahadin operatives by facilitating their travel. He is a
senior aide to Abu Zubaydah who was heavily involved in fund raising for a

terrorist operation in spring 2001."^^^^
Additional reporting noted that Hassan GhuFs phone number had
been linked to a terrorist operative who "was ready to conduct a 'surgical operation' at any

time,"^^^^ while other reporting indicated that Hassan Ghul was working on a "program"
believed to be related to terrorist activity.

According to CIA cables, once captured, and prior to the initiation
of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, Abu Zubaydah confirmed that Hassan Ghul was
a high-level al-Qa'ida facilitator who had contact with senior al-Qa'ida members, including

Hamza Rabi'a and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.^^^^ Abu Zubaydah also corroborated intelligence in
CIA databases that Ghul was involved in al-Qa'ida fundraising efforts.During this same
period, the CIA continued to receive additional intelligence on Ghul from foreign governments,
including that Ghul was responsible for facilitating the movement of Saudi fighters through

Pakistan.^^^^ As noted, on June 18, 2002, Abu Zubaydah was placed in isolation and was not

asked any questions for 47 days.^^^^

information specifically on Bin al-Shibh's whereabouts, but as the Study explicitly acknowledges, he did provide
information on another al-Qa'ida facilitator that prompted Pakistani action that netted Bin al-Shibh." The
Committee could find no CIA records of the CIA ever making this claun externally, or internally within the CIA,
prior to the CIA's June 2013 Response. Rather, as described, the CIA claimed both before and after the President's

vacated the apartment, he was scheduled to retum to the complex

Pakistani authorities placed the complex under surveillance and waited for Hassan Ghul to

return.^^^^ On September 10, 2002, Pakistani authorities arrested two individuals believed to be

the arrest of 11 individuals, including Ramzi bin al-Shibh.^Â®^^^ According to CIA records, bin alShibh initially identified himself as 'Umar Muhammad 'Abdullah ba-'Anu*, aka "Abu
'Ubyadah," but the CIA noted:

"This individual strongly resembled pictures of Ramzi bin al-Shibh. When

asked if he was videotaped in al-Qa'ida videos, he answered yes."^^^^
Shortly thereafter the CIA confirmed Ramzi bin al-Shibh was the
individual in Pakistani custody

Hassan Ghul was ultimately captured by foreign authorities in the
Iraqi Kurdistan Region, on January
2004.Hassan Ghul's capture was unrelated to any
reporting from the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.
4. The Capture ofKhalid Shaykh Mohammad (KSM)

On September 6, 2006, President Bush delivered a speech based on
information provided by the CIA, and vetted by the CIA, that included the following statement;
"Zubaydah was questioned using these procedures [the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques], and soon he began to provide information on key alQa'ida operatives, including information that helped us find and capture more

of those responsible for the attacks on Septemberthe 11^. For example,
Zubaydah identified one of KSM's accomplices in the 9/11 attacks, a terrorist
named Ramzi bin al-Shibh. The information Zubaydah provided helped lead
to the capture of bin al-Shibh. And together these two terrorists provided
information that helped in the planning and execution of the operation that

Contrary to CIA representations, there are no CIA records to
support the assertion that Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, or any other CIA detainee played
any role in the "the planning and execution of the operation that captured Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed." CIA records clearly describe how the capture of KSM was attributable to a
unilateral CIA asset ("ASSET

with
whom the CIA asset had prior independent connections. ASSET X's possible access to KSM
through
was apparent to the CIA as early as the fall of 2001, prior to his formal
recruitment. The CIA had multiple opportunities to exploit ASSET X's access to KSM's
in 2001, and in 2002, after he was recruited, but did not. In February-March 2003,
ASSET X led the CIA directly to KSM. The contemporaneous documentary record of this
narrative is supported by numerous after-action interviews conducted by the CIA's Oral History
Program. As the CIA officer who "handled" ASSET X and who was direcdy involved in the
capture of KSM stated, "[t]he op[eration] was a HUMINT op pretty much from start to
finish."^^^^

Within days after the attacks of September 11, 2001, CTC officers
suspected KSM of playing a key role in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.Shortly
thereafter, CTC officers also noted the "striking similarities" between the September 11, 2001,
attacks, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing by KSM's nephew, Ramzi Yousef,
On September 26, 2001, the CIA's ALEC

5. The Capture ofMajid Khan
The CIA represented that intelligence derived from the use of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against CIA detainee KSM led to the capture ofMajid
Khan. These representations were inaccurate.
In multiple interviews with the CIA Office of Inspector General,
CIA officers stated that "information from KSM led to the capture of [Majid] Kahn [sic]," and

that "KSI^gav^i^Maii^^an."^^^^ The deputy chief of ALEC Station and former KSM

debriefer

represented that KSM "provided information that helped lead to the

arrest of... Majid Khan, an operative who couldget into the U.S. easily."^^^^ The draft OIG
Special Review repeated the representations of
and others, stating that KSM "provided
information that helped lead to the arrests of terrorists including... Majid Khan, an operative
who could enter the United States easily and was tasked to research attacks against U.S. water
reservoirs.On February 27, 2004, DDO James Pavitt submitted the CIA's formal response
to the draft Inspector General Special Review. Pavitt's submission represented that Majid Khan
was in custody "because of the information we were able lawfully to obtain from KSM."^^^^ The
final, and now declassified, CIA Inspector General Special Review states that KSM "provided

CIA's June 2003 Response states that "CIA mistakenlyprovided incorrect information to the Inspector

General (IG) that led to a one-time misrepresentation of this case in the IG's 2004 Special Review." The CIA's June
2013 Response adds that, "[tjhis mistake was not, as it is characterized in the 'Findings and Conclusions' section of
the Study, a 'repeatedly represented' or 'frequently cited' example of the effectiveness of CIA's enhanced
interrogation program." TTie CIA's June 2013 assertion that this was a "one-time misrepresentation" is inaccurate.
As described, the inaccurate information was provided numerous times to the Inspector General, in multiple
interviews and in the CIA's official response to the draft Special Review. Afterwards, the CIA relied on the section
of the Special Review that included the inaccurate inforniation on the capture of Majid Khan in obtaining legal
approval for tlie use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques from the Department of Justice. Tliis
information was also provided by the CIA to the CIA's Blue Ribbon Panel for tlieir review of the CIA's Detention
and Interrogation Program. The CIA also included the inaccurate representation about the identification of Majid
Klian and his family to tlie National Security Council principals on multiple occasions. Further, as noted, the
inaccurate information in tlie CIA OIG Special Review was declassified and has been used in multiple open source
articles and books, often as an example of the effectiveness of the CIA program.

"This is intelligence that cannot be found any other place. And our security
depends on getting this kind of information."

information that helped stop the planned strike on U.S. Marines at Camp

Lemonier in Djibouti."^^"'^
An Office of the Director of National Intelligence public release

accompanying the September 6, 2006, speech, states that "the CIA designed a new interrogation
program that would be safe, effective, and legal." The document asserts: "In early 2004, shortly
after his capture, al-Qa'ida facilitator Gouled Hassan Dourad revealed that in mid-2003 alQa'ida East Africa cell leader Abu Talha al-Sudani sent him from Mogadishu to Djibouti to case
the US Marine base Camp Lemonier, as part of a plot to send suicide bombers with a truck
bomb."^^oi

Similarly, in a prepared briefing for the chairman of the House
Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, John Murtha, on October 30, 2007, the CIA represented
that the CIA could not conduct its detention operations at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, because
"interrogations conducted on US military installations must comply with the Army Field
Manual." The CIA presentation stated that the CIA program was "critical to [the CIA's] ability
See "CIA Validation of Remarks on Detainee Policy," drafts supporting the September 6, 2006, speech by

President George W. Bush acknowledging and describing the CIA's Detention and Intenogation Program, as well as
an unclassified Office of the Director of National Intelligence release, entitled, "Summary of the High Value
Tenorist Detainee Program." In October 2007 CIA officers discussed a section of the President's speech, which
was based on CIA information and vetted by the CIA, related to Camp Lemonier. Addressing tlie section of the
speech that states, "[t]errorists held in CIA custody have also provided information that helped stop the planned
strike on U.S. Marines at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti," a senior CIA officer higlilighted that the plotting had not
been stopped, but in fact was ongoing. The officer wrote: "I have attached the cable from Guleed that was used to
source the Sept '06 speech as well as a later cable from a different detainee affirming tliat as of mid-2004, AQ
members in Somalia were still intent on attacking Camp Lemonier... As of 2004, the second detainee indicates that
AQ was still working on attacking the base." The CIA officer explained that the "reasoning behind validation of the
language in the speechâand remember, we can argue about whether or not 'planning' consistitutes [sic] a 'plot' and

about whether anything is ever disruptedâwas that the detainee reportin^ncrea^^ awarenes^^tack plotting
against the base, leading to heightened security." {See email from;
to; H|H||||||||; subject:
"More on Camp Lemonier"; date; October 22, 2007, at 5:33 PM). The President's reference to Camp Lemonier in
tlie context of "this vital program" came immediately after the passage of the speech referencing the use of the
CIA's enhanced intenogation techniques against KSM and immediately before statements about the thwarting of the
Karachi and Heathrow Airport plots, both of which have been exphcitly attiibuted by the CIA to the use of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. The disruption of the Camp Lemonier plotting was also referenced as an
intelligence success in the context of the March 2008 presidential veto of legislation that would have effectively
banned the CIA's enhanced intenogation techniques. See "Text; Bush on Veto of Intelligence Bill," The New York
Times, dated March 8, 2008, which states, the "main reason this program has been effective is that it allows the CIA

to use specialized intenogation procedures... limiting the CIA's intenogation methods to those in the Army field
manual would be dangerous...."
Italics added. Unclassified Office of the Director of National Intelligence release, entitled, "Summary of the

High Value Tenorist Detainee Program." CIA records indicate that the CIA had intelligence that al-Qa'ida
affiliated individuals were targeting Camp Lemonier with an "explosives-laden tmck" in early 2003. The CIA
sought to detain Gouled because of the intelligence ahready collected, indicating that in 2003âat the likely behest of
Abu Talha al-SudaniâGouled was conducting casings of Camp Lemonier. Once captured, and prior to being
transfened to CIA custody, Gouled confumed that he cased Camp Lemonier for a potential tenorist attack. Despite
the use of the term "revealed" in the 2006 document, the CIA's June 2013 Response states: "We did not represent

that we initially learned of the plot from detainees, or that it was disrupted based solely on information from
detainees in CIA custody." The CIA's June 2013 Response further states that the CIA "agree[s] with the Study that
[tlie CIA] had threat reporting against Camp Lemonier prior to the March 2004 detention and rendition" of Guleed
Hassan Dourad.

to protect the American homeland and US forces and citizens abroad from terrorist attack," that

"[m]ost, if not all, of the intelligence acquired from high-value detainees in this [CIA] program
would Likely not have been discovered or reported in any other way," that the CIA program "is in
no way comparable to the detainee programs run by our military," and that the CIA used
information derived from the program "to disrupt terrorist plotsâincluding against our
militaryThe CIA presentation then stated:

"[A CIA detainee] informed us^^"^ of an operation underway to attack the U.S.
military at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti. We believe our understanding of this
plot helped us to prevent the attack.
A review of CIA records found that: (1) the detainee to whom the

CIA's representations referâGuleed (variant, Gouled) Hassan Douradâwas not subjected to the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques; (2) the CIA was aware of and reported on the terrorist
threat to Camp Lemonier prior to receiving any information from CIA detainees(3) Guleed
provided corroborative reporting on the threat prior to being transferred to CIA custody; and (4)
contrary to CIA representations, the plotting did not "stop" because of information acquired from
CIA detainee Guleed in 2004, but rather, continued well into 2007.^^^^
Emphasis in original. See CIA Talking Points dated October 30, 2007, entitled, "DCIA Meeting with Chairman
Murdia re Rendition a^d Detention Programs" and attachments.

jiie CIA's June 2013 Response states; "We did not represent that we initially learned of the plot from detainees,
or that it was disrupted based solely on infomiation from detainees in CIA custody." The CIA's October 30, 2007,
talking points for the chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, John Murtha, make no
reference to the CIA receiving intelligence on theCamp Lemonierplottingfrom other intelligencesources prior to
CIA detainee reporting. Nor do the talking pointsindicate that the CIA detainee initially provided informationon
the plotting prior to being transferred to CIA custody. In addition, as described, an Office of the Director of

National Intelligence public releaseon the CIA's Detention and Interrogaton Program from September 6, 2006,
states that "the CIA designed a new interrogationprogram that would be safe, effective, and legal;" and that "alQa'ida facilitator Gouled Hassan Douradrevealed" that he had been sent to "case the US Marine base Camp
Lemonier."

See CIA Talking Points dated October 30, 2007, entitled, "DCIA Meeting with Chainnan Murtlia re Rendition
and Detention Programs" and attachments. The talking points further state that the "Presidentially-mandated
detention program is critical to our ability to protect the American homeland and US forces and citizens abroad from
teiTorist attack." The attachment to the document, labeled "points from CTC," further asserts that while CIA

rendition activities "did yield intelligence, it did not do so in a timely, efficient, and thorough way, raising
unacceptable risks," and that the CIA "experiencehas shown that exclusive control by CIA, in a Agency designed,
built, and managed facility, allows us complete oversight and control over all aspects of detention, to include
conditions of confinement, approved interrogation activities, humane standards, medical treatment, detainee

engagement, security, hygiene, and infrastructure." The document references a U.S. House of Representatives
Appropriations bill providing a reduction in funding for the Covert Action CT Program and states: "Had the mark
been directed against the rendition and detention programs specifically, the CIA would have recommended a

Presidential veto. In its appeal, CIA detailed the impact ofa$H| million cut to the CA CT Program. The Agency
also made it clear that it would continue the rendition and detention program because of the high value of these
activities."

See aforementioned CIA representations that: (1) "This is intelligence that cannot be found any other place. And
our security depends on getting this kind of information,"and (2) "Most, if not all, of the intelligence acquired from
high-value detainees in this [CIA] program wouldlikely not have been discovered or reported in any other way."
As noted, the CIA's June 2013 Response states tliat the CIA "agree[s] with the Study that [the CIA] had threat
reporting against Camp Lemonier prior to the March 2004 detention and rendition" of Guleed.

March 4, 2004, Guleed was captured in Djibouti based on
information obtained from a foreign government and a CIA source.Prior to entering CIA
custody, Guleed was confronted with information acquired from signals intelligence, and he
confirmed that he cased Camp Lemonier for a potential teiTorist attack.
CIA sought to render
Guleed to CIA custody in order to question Guleed about senior al-Qa'ida East Africa members
Abu Talha al-Sudani and Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan. A CIA cable states:

"Guleed represents the closest we have come to an individual with first hand,
face-to-face knowledge of Abu Talha [al-Sudani] and Nabhan, and our hope is
that Guleed will provide key intelligence necessary for the capture of these
senior al-Qa'ida members.

the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, nor are there any CIA records to indicate that
Guleed provided the information that was the basis for his rendition to CIA custodyâ

raised the necessary funds via tlie bank robbery operation,and that "he [Guleed] was not

informed of the operational plan."^^^'^
Neither the detention of Guleed, nor the information he provided,
thwarted terrorist plotting against Camp Lemonier; and CIA records indicate that attack planning
against Camp Lemonier continued well after Guleed's capture in March 2004, to include a time

period beyond the president's September6, 2006, speech. In March 2005, the CIA sought
approval to render an associate of Guleed whom the CIA stated was "planning terrorist attacks
on U.S. targets in East Africa, particularly against Camp Lemonier in Djibouti.In October
2005, a cable stated, "a body of reporting indicates that East Africa al-Qa'ida network operatives
are currently planning attacks on U.S. interests in the region, particularly... the U.S. military

base Camp Lemonier in Djibouti,"'^^^ In April 2007, thecontinued terrorist threat reporting
against Camp Lemonier resulted in a request for the Camp to further "alter their security
practices."^^^^
In October 2007, in light of the ongoing threat reporting related to
Camp Lemonier, CIA officer
attempted to explain the CIA-validated
statement in the president's September 6, 2006, speech that "[tjerrorists held in CIA custody
"helped stop the planned strike on U.S. Marines at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti.
The CIA's June 2013 Response links the "disrupt[ion]" of the Camp Lemonier plotting to
the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program via the arrest of KSM, stating: "According to Khalid Shaykh
Muhammad (KSM), his arrest in March 2003 (which we note in Example 12 resulted in part from infomiation
provided by Ramzi Bin al-Shibh) prevented him from transferring 30,000 euros from al-Qa'ida in Pakistan to al1913

Qa'ida in East Africa leaders, someof\^iomwere plotting the Camp Lemonier attack. Funding shortages were cited
repeatedly by detainees and in
[technical collection] as a reason for the Camp Lemonier plot's
delays." Prior to the CIA's June 2013 Response, there were no CIA records attributing the delay or disruptionof the
plotting to the capture or detention of KSM. While a body of intelligence reporting indicated that fimding shortages
contributed to delays in the targeting of Camp Lemonier, no CIA intelligence records were identified that cite any
deficit of expected funds resulting from KSM's capture. As detailed in this Study, KSM was captured on March 1,
2003. Intelligence reporting indicates that Abu Talha al-Sudani sent Guleed to case the security at Camp Lemonier

more than six months later, in September 2003. In early March 2004, the CIA reported that |||^^||||||^g
[technical collection] revealed that "Abu Talha and Guleed were working together in search of funding necessary to
carry out planned operations." In late March 2004, after Guleed's detention, several associates were detained after

an attack on a German aid delegation, whicl^a^uspe^d ofbeing an attempt to kidnap individuals for ransom. A
cable reporting this information stated that^^^^^^| [technical collection] "indicated Abu Talha continues to
press forward on plans to target Western interests in Djibouti." Several days later, CIA officers surmised that the

kidnapping attempt was likely an attempt "by Abu Talha to raise the operational funds for his plan to attack Camp

Lem^ier." {See intelligence chronology in Volum^I^ncludin^jepoi^^

who was involved in vetting of the speech, wrote to a CIA colleague tracking the ongoing threats
to Camp Lemonier that:
"The reasoning behind [the CIA] validation of the language in the speechâand
remember, we can argue about whether or not 'planning' consistitutes [sic] a
'plot' and about whether anything is ever disruptedâwas that the detainee
reporting increased our awareness of attack plotting against the base, leading to
heightened security.
A review of CIA records, however, found no indication that CIA

detainee reporting from Guleed, or any other CIA detainee, alerted the CIA or the U.S. military
to increased terrorist targeting of Camp Lemonier. To the conti"ary, CIA records indicate that the
CIA was in possession of substantial threat reporting demonstrating that Camp Lemonier in
Djibouti was being targeted by al-Qa'ida and al-Qa'ida affiliated extremists prior to the detention

of Guleed on March 4, 2004.'^-" For example, on January 28, 2003, a foreign government report
disseminated by the CIA stated that al-Qa'ida operatives were planning "to ram an explosivesladen truck into a military base, probably Camp Lemonier."On March 10, 2003, a "Terrorist
Advisory" was issued, which stated that "U.S. forces stationed at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti...

See January 28, 2003, CIA Presidential Daily Brief, entitled, "Al-Qa'ida Planning Attack in Djibouti." The
CIA's June 2013 Response states that the CIA "agree[s] with the Study that [the CIA] had threat reporting against
Camp Lemonier prior to the March 2004 detention and rendition" of Guleed, but argues that the threat reporting
provided to the President on Januaiy 28, 2003, had "no relation to [al-Sudani's] plot," and was "later recalled after
being revealed to be a fabrication." The CIA did not provide a date for the recall. The reporting, which indicated alQa'ida operatives were planning "to ram an explosives-laden truck into a military base, probably Camp Lemonier,"
would later be corroborated by other intelligence reporting, including by Guleed in his description of al-Sudani's
plotting. See intelligence chronology in Volume II.

that al-Qa'ida affiliates were "waiting for the right time to cany out large-scale attacks, possibly involving suicide
bombers, against a U.S. military base or U.S. naval ship in or near Djibouti." The CIA's June 2013 Response states
that this threat reporting "was later found to be unrelated." Notwithstanding these assertions, the CIA's June 2013
Response states that the CIA "agree[s] with the Study that [the CIA] had threat reporting against Camp Lemonier
prior to the March 2004 detention and rendition" of Guleed.

Djiboutian authorities confirmed that Guleed had cased Camp Lemonier and that Guleed

7. The Assertion that CIA Detainees Subjected to Enhanced Interrogation Techniques Help
Validate CIA Sources

In addition to CIA claims that information produced during or after
the use of CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques led to the disruption of terrorist plots and the
capture of specific terrorists, the CIA also represented that its enhanced interrogation techniques
were necessary to validate CIA sources. The claim was based on one CIA detaineeâJanat
Gulâcontradicting the reporting of one CIA asset.

The CIA repeatedly represented to policymakers that information
acquired after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques helped to "validate" CIA
sources. For example, CIA Director Michael Hayden provided testimony to the Committee on
April 12, 2007, that:

"Detainee information is a key tool for validating clandestine sources. In fact,
in one case, the detainee's information proved to be the accurate story, and the
clandestine source was confronted and subsequently admitted to embellishing
or fabricating some or all [of] the details in his report."

Similarly, in January 2009, the CIA compiled a detailed briefing
book for a planned three-hour briefing of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program for
President-elect Obama's national security staff. Included in the materials was a document that
stated, "[k]ey intelligence [was] collected from HVD interrogations after applying [the CIA's
enhanced] interrogation techniques." After this statement, the CIA provided examples, including
that the "most significant reporting" acquired from CIA detainee Janat Gul after applying the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was information that helped the CIA "validate a CIA
asset."'^^Â®^ The document states:

"Pakistan-based facilitator Janat Gul's most significant reporting helped us
validate a CIA asset who was providing information about the 2004 pre
election threat. The asset claimed that Gul had arranged a meeting between
himself and al-Qa'ida's chief of finance, Shaykh Sa'id, a claim that Gul
vehemently denied. Gul's reporting was later matched with information
obtained from Sharif al-Masri and Abu Talha al-Pakistani, captured after Gul.
With this reporting in hand, CIA

admitted to fabricating his reporting about the meeting."^^^^
The CIA representation that the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques produced information that allowed the CIA to identify the reporting of a CIA asset as
fabricated lacked critical contextual information. The CIA representations did not describe how
the CIA asset's reporting was already doubted by CIA officers prior to the use of the CIA's
enlianced inten'ogation techniques against Gul. Nor did the CIA representations acknowledge
that the asset's fabricated reporting was the reason that Janat Gul was subjected to the techniques
in the first place. The CIA concluded that Janat Gul was not a high-level al-Qa'ida figure and
did not possess threat information, but this conclusion was not included in CIA representations.

In March 2004, the CIA received reporting from a CIA asset,
"ASSET

inside the United States. The attacks were reportedly planned to occur prior to the U.S. elections

officials were "not v^orking." {See CIA briefing slides, CIA Request for Guidance Regarding Interrogation
of Janat Gul, July 2, 2004). National Security Advisor Rice later stated in a letter to the CIA Director that "CIA

According to handv^ritten notes of the briefing, CIA briefers described Janat Gul as "senior AQ" and a "key
facilitator" with "proximity" to a suspected pre-election plot. Committee records indicate that CIA briefers told the
chairman and vice chainnan that, given the pre-election threat, it was "incumbent" on the CIA to "review [the] need

Janat Gul was rendered to CIA custody on July
2004.^^"^^ On
August 2, 2004, Janat Gul denied knowledge of any imminent threats against the United States
homeland. Gul's denial was deemed a "strong resistance posture" by CIA detention site
personnel.Janat Gul was then subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques from
August 3, 2004, to August 10, 2004, and then again from August 21, 2004, to August 25,
2004.'948

On August 19, 2004, CIA personnel wrote that the interrogation
"team does not believe [Gul] is withholding imminent threat information."On August 25,
2004, CIA interrogators sent a cable to CIA Headquarters stating that Janat Gul "may not possess
all that [the CIA] believes him to know." The interrogators added that the interrogation "team
maintains a degree of caution in some areas, as many issues linking [Gul] to al-Qaida ai'e derived
from single source reporting," a reference to the CIA source, ASSET
That same day, August 25, 2004, the CIA's associate general
counsel provided a letter to the DOJ seeking approval to use additional CIA enhanced
interrogation techniques against Janat Gul: dietary manipulation, nudity, water dousing, and the
abdominal slap. The letter asserted that Janat Gul had information concerning "imminent threats
to the United States" and "information that might assist in locating senior al-Qa'ida operatives
whose removal from the battlefield could severely disrupt planned terrorist attacks against the
United States." The letter stated;

"In addition, CIA understands that before his capture, Gul had been working to
facilitate a direct meeting between the
CIA
source reporting
on the pre-election threat [ASSET Y] and Abu Faraj himself; Gul had arranged
a previous meeting between [ASSET Y] and al-Qa'ida finance chief Shaykh
Sa'id at which elements of the pre-election threat were discussed."

The letter from the CIA's associate general counsel asserted that
Janat Gul's "resistance increases when questioned about matters that may connect him to alQa'ida or evidence he has direct knowledge of operational terrorist activities."'^^- The letter
stated that the CIA sought approval to add four enhanced interrogation techniques to Janat Gul's

Headquarters stated that Janat Gul "is believed to possess information about risks to the citizens of the United States

CIA Headquarters was therefore approving theresumed use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against

opportunity for the interrogation team to obtain his cooperation."^^''^ On August 26, 2004,
Acting Assistant Attorney General Dan Levin informed CIA Acting General Counsel Rizzo that
the use of the four additional enhanced interrogation techniques did not violate any U.S. statutes,
the U.S. Constitution, or U.S. treaty obligations. Levin's letter stated that "[w]e understand that
[Janat] Gul is a high-value al Qaeda operative who is believed to possess information concerning
an imminent terrorist threat to the United States."^^^"^

August 27, 2004, Gul's CIA interrogators reported that "in
terms of overt indications of resistance, [Gul's] overall resistance is currently judged to be

minimal."^^^^ Nonetheless, on August 31, 2004, the CIA interrogators asked CIA Headquarters

to approve an extension of all CIA enhanced interrogation techniques against Janat Gul.^^^^ The
CIA's associate general counsel objected, writing:

"In the end, its [sic] going to be an operational call. I just want to be siu*e that
the record is clear that we're not acting precipitously and are taking into
consideration everything we're learning about this guy. We open ourselves up
to possible criminal liability if we misuse the interrogation techniques. I
reflect again on the cable or cables from the interrogation team that opines that
physical EITs (facial slap, walling, etc.) do not work on him. I would sti'ongly
encourage, then, HQS not to approval [sic] the use of physical interrogation
techniques because if they don't work, then our motives are questionable. If

our motives might bequestioned, then we get ourselves in trouble."^^^^
Despite these concerns, on September 3, 2004, CIA Headquarters
released a cable extending approval for sleep deprivation for 30 days. CIA records indicate,
however, that Gul was not subjected to sleep deprivation, or any other enhanced interrogation

technique, foUowing this approval.^^^^
On September 7, 2004, more than a month after Janat Gul was
rendered to CIA custody, a CIA officer who had observed the interrogations of Gul prepared a
memorandum for the leadership of the CIA's Renditions, Detentions, and Interrogations Group,
stating:

Zubaydah, KSM, and similar level HVDs. [Janat Gul] should likewise not be

considered an operational planner or even an operator. It is very likely that
[Janat Gul] came into contact with operational information, but we lack
credible information that ties him to pre-election threat information or direct
operational planning against the United States, at home or abroad. Likewise,
we lack any substantive information that connects [Janat Gul] to UBL,

Zawahiri, and Abu Faraj Al-Libi."^^^^
Oil September 16, 2004, CIA detention site personnel wrote that
Janat Gul's reporting directly contradicted information from ASSET Y from March 2004, and

stated that, "[m]uch of our derogatory information on [Gul] came from [ASSET Y] reporting, as
did much of our pre-election threat information.

On September 17, 2004, following the reports about the
discrepancies between the comments made by Janat Gul and ASSET Y, as well as similar denials
from Sharif al-Masri, who was in foreign government custody, the CIA undertook a
counterintelligence review of ASSET Y to assess the validity of ASSET Y's reporting.

//NF) On October i^004^nd October |, 2004, CIA officers provided a
assessment of ASSET Y. That

assessment indicated that ASSET Y was

deceptive in response to questions regarding his alleged meeting with a senior al-Qa'ida official,
Shaykh Sa'id, at which ASSET Y claimed to have learned about the pre-election threat. ASSET
Y then admitted to having fabricated the information about the meeting.
Despite the recantation of reporting from ASSET Y, officers from

the CIA's ALEC Station continued to assess that Janat Gul "was one of the highest-ranking
facilitators in Pakistan with long-standing access to senior leaders in al-Qa' ida" and other

groups.^^^^ This assessment was not shared by CIA personnel involved in Gul's interrogation.
On November 10, 2004, the CIA's chief of Base at DETENTION SITE BLACK, the CIA

detention site hosting Gul, wrote that the words used by ALEC Station to describe Janat Gul:
Rather than a "high value detainee," the memo characterized Janat Gul as a "senior facilitator." The CIA officer

concluded that Gul was likely "not directlyincludedin operational planning and operations." See September 7,

2004^I^Dorament EYES ONLY -

written by

1706 (161749Z SEP 04). The CIA's June 2013 Response states that "Janat Gul's claim that
[ASSET Y] never met the al-Qa'ida finance chiefâwho [ASSET Y] said told him about the pre-election tlireatâ
was vital to CIA's assessment and handlingofttieMse. CIA officers assessed Gul was cooperating during his

interrogations by that time, leading CIA toj|||m||||| [ASSET Y] on the meeting and the plot, which he ultimately
recanted." As described earlier, CIA records indicate that Janat Gul denied knowledge of any imminent threats
against the United States homeland, which had been reported by ASSET Y, prior to the use of the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques against Gul. At the time, Gul's denial was deemed a "strong resistance posture"

pressure from his handling [CIA] officer to produce leads as the catalyst for his Ues." ASSET Y continued to assert

that he discussed the pre-election threat with Janat Gul, who, as noted, had denied to CIA interrogators that he had
any knowledge^ imminent threats to the United States.

..fly in the face of what is now a rather long history of debriefings which, 1
would assert, paint a very different picture of him. While [Janat Gul] was
certainly a facilitator, describing him as 'highest-ranking' gives him a stature
which is undeserved, overblown and misleading. Stating that he had 'long
standing access to senior leaders in al-Qa'ida' is simply wrong.... To put it
simply, [Janat Gul] is not the man we thought he was. While he no doubt had
associations and interactions with people of interest, [Janat Gul] is not the
pivotal figure our pre-detention descriptions of him suggest. We do a
disservice to ourselves, the mission and even [Janat Gul] by allowing

misperceptions of this man to persist."^^^
On November 22, 2004, a CIA officer noted the discrepancy

between the CIA's description of Janat Gul as a "potential source of intelligence information
regarding an attack by al-Qa'ida" in a draft OLC memorandum and the current assessment of
Janat Gul.'^^^ In an email, the CIA officer indicated that he had spoken to the CIA's associate
general counsel,
informed him that "the state of our knowledge about
Gul had evolved since he was captured." The email noted that, "[a]t first, we believed he had
attack information of a more imminent nature," but "[n]ow it appears that he does not have such
would talk to personnel at OLC about the issue
information," The email indicated that

to "[amend] the draft opinion to reflect the state of ourknowledge."^^^^ The OLC memorandum
was not updated.

On December 19, 2004, CIA detention site personnel wrote again
that Janat Gul was "not/not the man [CIA Headquarters] made him out to be," and that "[h]e is a
very simple man who, no doubt, did a capable job as a facilitator but he is not the link to senior

AQ leaders that [CIA Headquarters] said he was/is."^^^^

CIA "Comments on Detainees," December 19, 2004, notes from DETENTION SITE BLACK. In April 2005,
the chief of Base where Janat Gul was held emailed that "[Janat Gul] was never the person we thought he was. He
is not the senior Al-Qa'ida facilitator that he has been labeled. He's a rather poorly educated village man with a

very simple outlook on life. He's also quite lazy and it's the combination of his background and lack of initiative
that got him in trouble. He was looking to make some easy money for little work and he was easily persuaded to
move people and run errands for folks on our target list. While he openly admits that he helped move people, it's
pretty well established that the vast majority of liis work involved seeking medical care and providing housing for

April 6, 2005, as the OLC approached completion of its

analysis of the legality of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, the OLC asked the CIA
about the interrogation of Gul using the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, specifically,
"what [the CIA] got from Janat Gul, was it valuable, [and] did it help anything....The CIA

di^ioHmmediately respond to this request and the CIA's Associate General Counsel
noted that OLC personnelhad "taken to calling [him] daily" for information.
April 14, 2005, a CIA officeremailed
talking points stating that:

On

"Pakistan-based facilitator Janat Gul's most significant reporting helped us
validate a CIA asset who was providing information about the 2004 pre
election threat. The asset claimed that Gul had arranged a meeting between
himself and al-Qa'ida's chief of finance, Shaykh Sa'id, a claim that Gul
vehemently denied.

Gul's reporting was later matched with information obtained from Sharif al-

Masr^n^Abu Talha, captured after Gul. With this reporting inhand, CIA
the asset, who subsequently admitted to fabricating his reporting
about the meeting."
May 10, 2005, the OLC issued a formal memorandum that

included a discussion of the legality of the use of the CIA's enhancedinterrogation techniques

against Janat Gul.^^^' Citing information provided in the CIA's August 25, 2004, letter, the OLC
memorandum stated:

"You asked for our advice concerning these interrogation techniques in
connection with their use on a specific high value al Qaeda detainee named
Janat Gul. You informed us that the CIA believed Gul had information about

al Qaeda's plans to launch an attack within the United States. According to
CIA's information, Gul had extensive connections to various al Qaeda leaders,
members of the Taliban, and the al-Zarqawi network, and had arranged
meetings between an associate and al Qaeda's finance chief to discuss such an
attack. .. .Our conclusions depend on these assessments,

On May 30, 2005, the OLC issued a memorandum concluding that
the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against CIA detainees did not violate
Article 16 of the Convention Against Torture.

In the memorandum. Principal Deputy

Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury used the example of Janat Gul as a detainee who
was "representative of the high value detainees on whom enhanced techniques have been, or

might be, used."^^^'^
Citing information from the CIA's August 25, 2004, letter,
Bradbury wrote:

"the CIA believed [that Janat Gul] had actionable intelligence concerning the

pre-election threat to the United States... Gul had extensive connections to
various al Qaeda leaders, members of the Taliban, and the al-Zarqawi network,
and intelligence indicated that 'Gul had arranged a... meeting between [a
source] and al-Qa'ida finance chief Shaykh Sa'id at which
elements of the pre-election threat were discussed.

As noted, the CIA had represented that the use of the CIA's
enhanced inteiTogation techniques was necessary for Janat Gul to provide information on an
imminent threat to the United States, the pre-election threat. As further noted, Gul did not

provide this information and records indicate tliatthe threat was based on fabricated CIA source
reporting. When the OLC requested the results of using the CIA's enhanced inten'ogation
techniques against Janat Gul, the CIA represented that "Gul has provided information that has
helped the CIA with validating one of its key assets reporting on the pre-election threat." This
information was included in the May 30, 2005, OLC memorandum, which also stated that Gul's

information "contradicted the asset's contentionthat^Gul met with Shaykh Sa'id," and that,
"[a]nned with Gul's assertions, the CIA

the asset, who then admitted that he had

lied about the meeting."^^^^ There are no indications in the memorandum that the CIA informed

the OLC that CIA officers had concluded that Gul had no information about the pre-election
threat and had determined that Gul was "not the man we thought he was."'^^^ As noted, after the
May 30, 2005, OLC memorandum, the CIA continued to represent that the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques allowed the CIA to validate sources.

8. The Identification and Arrests of Uzhair and Saifullah Paracha
The CIA represented that information obtained through the use of

the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques produced otherwise unavailable intelligence that led
to the identification and/or arrest of UzhairParacha and his father SaifullahParacha (aka, Sayf
al-Rahman Paracha). These CIA representations include inaccurate information and omit

significant material informationâspecifically a body of intelligence reporting acquired prior to
CIA detainee reporting that linked the Parachas to al-Qa'ida-related activities.
CIA representations also credit the use of the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques with the identification of a plot to smuggle explosives into the United
States involving the Parachas.CIA records indicate that the plotting was denied by the
supposed participants, and that at least one senior CIA counterten'orism official questioned the
plausibility of the explosives smuggling plot given the relative ease of acquiring explosive
material in the United States.

The CIA provided information to the CIA Office of Inspector
General that "EITs (including the water board) have been indispensable to our successes," and
stated that the CIA OIG Special Review should have come to the "conclusion that our efforts

have thwarted attacks and saved lives."'^^^ The CIA further represented to tiie OIG that KSM

United States Obligations Under Article 16of the Convention Against Torture to Certain Techniques that May Be
Used in the Interrogation of High Value al Qaeda Detainees.

The OLC relied on CIA representations that Janat Gul had infoniiation, but thathe withheld it. In describing the
interrogation process, the OLC stated tliat Janat GuI's resistance increased as questioning moved to his "'knowledge
of operational terrorist activities.'" The OLC also wrote that "Gul apparently feigned memory problems (which CIA
psychologists ruled out tlirough intelligence and memory tests) in order to avoid answering questions." The OLC
further conveyedthat the "CIA believes that Janat Gul continues to downplay his knowledge." See Memorandum
for John A. Rizzo, SeniorDeputy General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, from Steven G. Bradbury,
Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, May 30, 2005, Re: Application of United
StatesObligations Under Article 16of the Convention Against Torture to Certain Techniques that May Be Used in
the Interrogation of High Value al Qaeda Detainees.

As described elsewhere, on April 21, 2009, a CIA spokesperson confirmed the accuracyof the information in
the OLC memorandum in response to the partial declassification of this memorandum and others.

"provided information that helped lead to the arrest of... Uzair Paracha, a smuggler,"and that
"as a result of the lawful use of EITs";

"KSM identified a mechanism for al-Qa'ida to smuggle explosives into the US
via a Pakistani businessman and textile merchant who shipped his material to
the US. The businessman had agreed to use this method to help al-Qa'ida

smuggle in explosives for follow-on attacks to 9/11."^^^^
Similarly, on July 29, 2003, the CIA made a presentation to a
select group of National Security Council principals, including Vice President Cheney, seeking
policy reaffirmation of the CIA interrogation program. The CIA briefing materials state that "the
use of the [CIA interrogation] techniques has produced significant results," and warned that
"[t]ermination of this [CIA] program wiU result in loss of life, possibly extensive." The CIA
conveyed that "[m]ajor threats were countered and attacks averted," and under a briefing slide
entitled "RESULTS: MAJOR THREAT INFO," represented that information obtained from
KSM after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques led to the "identification" of
Saifullah Paracha.

A widely disseminated CIA Intelligence Assessment, entitled
"Detainee Reporting Pivotal for the War Against Al-Qa'ida," that was described in internal CIA
emails as being "put together using past assessments" and initially intended for the White House

only, with "marching orders" to "throw everything in it,"^^^^ states:
"Since 11 September 2001, detainee reporting has become a crucial pillar of

terrorists, helping to thwart terrorist plots... KSM's revelation in March 2003
, Memorandum for the Record; subject: Meeting with Deputy Chief, Counterterrorist Center

Review of the Inspector General, which states that KSM "provided information that helped lead to the arrests of
tenorists including Sayfuliah Paracha and his son Uzair, businessmen whom Khalid Shaykh Muhammad planned to
use to smuggle explosives in New York." (See CIA InspectorGeneral Special Review, Counterteri'orism Detention
and Interrogation Activities (September 2001 - October 2003) (2003-7123-IG), 7 May 2004). The statements in the
Special Review regarding the purported effectiveness of the program, including the reference to the Parachas, were
cited by the Office of Legal Counsel in its analysis of the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques. See

Saifullah al-Rahman Parachaâto smuggle explosives into the United States
for a planned attack in New York prompted the FBI to investigate Paracha's
business ties in the United States

CIA representations related to the "identification" of the Parachas

and/or the anrest of Uzair Parachaâas well as the identificationof an explosives smuggling
plotâomit significantinformation acquired by the Intelligence Community prior to any
reporting from CIA detainees. Specifically, prior to KSM's reporting, the Intelligence
Community had already collected and acted upon significant information related to the Paracha
family's connections to al-Qa'ida and international terrorism:

â¢

Information on Saifullah Paracha was found in documents seized during a March 28,
2002, raid against al-Qa'ida targets associated with Hassan Ghul, which resulted in the

capture of Abu Zubaydah. The documents identified "Saifullah Piracha" (the spelling
found in the document seized during the raid) and phone numbers, which would be
associated with his Karachi-based business. International Merchandise Pvt Ltd, as early
as April 2002. An address associated with the business was also identified.

â¢

The name "Saifullah Piracha" was provided to Pakistani officials by the CIA in
December 2002. The CIA wrote: "Information below leads us to believe that the

following individual and phone numbers may have a connection to al-Qa'ida and
international terrorism.... We request your assistance in investigating this individual to
determine if he is involved in terrorist activity." The request included three phone
numbers found in the documents seized on March 28, 2002, one of which was associated

with Saifullah Paracha's Karachi-based company, International Merchandise Pvt Ltd.^'^^^
â¢

In April 2002, the FBI opened an investigation on another
at a
New York-based business associated with Saifullah Paracha. During the course of the
investigation, the FBI interviewed an employer at a New York address and acquired
additional information on the business and the Parachas.

Based on the information obtained during the September 2002 raids, the CIA informed
the FBI, the NSA, and the Department of Treasury that they suspected "Saifullah
Paracha" was engaged in terrorist financing activities, specifically for al-Qa'ida. The
cable included detailed information on Saifullah Paracha and International Merchandise

â¢

KSM stated that he was close to Uzhair's father, Sayf al-Rahman Paracha, who provided
assistance through his business and by helping to find safe houses in Karachi.-^^Â®

â¢

KSM claimed that Ammar al-Baliichi and Majid Khan approached Sayf al-Rahman
Paracha with a plan to use Sayf al-Rahman Paracha's textile business to smuggle
explosives into the United States. KSM stated that Paracha agreed to this plan and was
arranging the details with Ammar al-Baluchi and Majid Khan at the time of his (KSM's)

capture.~Â®^^ A later CIA cable provided additional background, stating: "KSM did not
volunteer [the explosives plot] information on Paracha. He provided this reporting only
when confronted with details on his role and otlier information on the plot, which had
been provided by detainee Majid Khan," who was in foreign government custody
According to CIA records, on March 28, 2003, at a FBI field

office, Uzhair Paracha provided significant information to interviewing FBI special agents on his
father's links to al-Qa'ida and his own efforts to assist Majid Khan's reentry to the United States.

Uzhair denied knowing anything about an explosives smuggling plot.^'^^
April 29, 2003, Ammar al-Baluchi was detained by Pakistani

9. Critical Intelligence Alerting the CIA to Jajfar al-Tayyar
The CIA made repeated claims that the use of the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques resulted in "key intelligence" from Abu Zubaydah and KSM on an
operative named Jaffar al-Tayyar,later identified as Adnan el-Shukrijumah.^^^"^ These CIA
representations frequently asserted that information obtained from KSM after the use of the

CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques resulted in an FBI investigation that prompted alTayyar to flee the United States. These representations were inaccurate. KSM was captured on
March 1, 2003. Jaffar al-Tayyar departed the United States in May 2001.^Â®^^
CIA representations also omitted key contextual facts, including
that: (1) the Intelligence Community was interested in the Florida-based Adnan el-Shukiijumah

prior to the detention of the CIA's first detainee;^Â®^^ (2) CIA detainee Abu Zubaydah provided a
description and information on a KSM associate named Jaffar al-Tayyar to FBI special agents in

imprecise language, but these mistakes were not central to our representations and none invalidates our assessment
that detainee reporting providedkey intelligence on this important tenorist." As one of two examples, the CIA's
June 2013 Response acknowledges that the "[CIA] inconectly stated al-Tayyarfled the UnitedStates in responseto
the FBI investigation, although he had in fact already departed the United States by this time." The Committee
found that this inaccurate statement was central to the CIA's representations. The CIA asserted that "Ja'far alTayyar" fled the United States becauseof KSM's reporting after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation

techniques in the context of representations that the use of the techniques "has been a key reason why al-Qa'ida has
failed to launch a spectacular attack in the West."

May 2002, prior to being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques(3) CIA
personnel distmsted KSM's reporting on Jaffar al-Tayyarâstating that KSM fabricated
information and had inserted al-Tayyar "into practically every story, each time with a different

role";^Â°^^ (4) other CIA detainee reporting differed from KSM's reporting in significant
ways;^^^^ and (5) CIArecords indicate that KSM did not identify al-Tayyar's true name and that
it was Jose Padillaâin military custody and being questioned by the FBIâwho provided al-

Tayyar's true name as Adnan el-Shukrijumah.^^-^ Finally, the CIA attributed to KSM the
characterization of al-Tayyar as the "next Mohammed Atta," despite clarifications from KSM to
the contrary

For example, in a March 2, 2005, CIA memorandum with the
subject line, "Effectiveness of the CIA Counterterrorist Interrogation Techniques," the CIA
responded to a request from the Office of Legal Counsel "for the intelligence the Agency
obtained from detainees who, before their interrogations, were not providing any information of

"CIA's use of DOJ-approved enhanced inteiTogation techniques, as part of a
comprehensive interrogation approach, has enabled CIA to disrupt ten-orist
plots, capture additional terrorists, and collect a high volume of critical

Prior to receiving information from the CIA's Detention and

Adnan el-Shukrijumah several times between September 2001 and October 2002 concerning
their son and his suspected contact with a known extremist. The family provided no significant
information on their son, except to alert the FBI that he had departed the United States circa May
2001.2^2^

CIA representations that Jaffar al-Tayyar fled the United States in
2003 in response to an investigation prompted by reporting from KSM were incongruent with
CIA records at the time of tlie representations, which indicated that al-Tayyar had already
relocated to Pakistan. In March 2003, when Jose Padilla identified Jaffar al-Tayyar as Adnan alShukrijumah, he stated that he had last seen al-Tayyar at a KSM safehouse in Karachi, Pakistan,

in March 2002.^^^^ Other reporting indicated al-Tayyar'spresence in Pakistan in 2002 and 2003,
as well. For example, KSM consistently reported that al-Tayyar was not in the United States and
noted during a 2004 interrogation that al-Tayyar "would not return to the United States because

interrogation techniquesâand while being questioned by FBI special agentsâCIA detainee Abu
Zubaydah provided information on "Abu Jafar al-Tayer" in the context of discussing associates
of KSM. Abu Zubaydah provided a detailed description of "Abu Jafar al-Tayer" and stated that
he was an English speaker who had studied in the United States. Abu Zubaydah stated that he
first met "Abu Jafar al-Tayer" in Birmal, Afghanistan, circa January 2002, and that "Abu Jafar
al-Tayer" was at that time seeking to travel to Pakistan. Abu Zubaydah repeated that "Abu Jafar

skin."^^^^ Abu Zubaydah did not provide significant additional information on Abu Jaffar alTayyar after the CIA used its enlianced interrogation techniques against him in August 2002."^^^

over the course of the next two weeks, during the period when
KSM was being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniquesâinckiding the
waterboardâKSM referred to Jaffar al-Tayyar as being engaged in multiple terrorist operations.
As a result, the CIA's detention site began describing Jaffar as the "all-purpose" al-Tayyar whom
KSM had "woven... into practically every story, each time with a different role."-Â®'^^ CIA

that were deemed not to be credible by CIA personnel,including, but not limited to,
statements that:

March 12, 2003, when KSM was confronted with a page in his
notebook about al-Tayyar, KSM stated that he "considered al-Tayyar to be the 'next 'emir' for

an attack against the US, in the same role that Muhammad Atta had for 11 September."-^^^ On

before Padilla - you get the point. Anyway, I'm still worried he might be

misdirecting us on Jafar."-^'''^
An officer from CIA Headquarters responded, "I agree.. .KSM is
yanking our chain about Jafar... really trying hard to throw us off course... suggesting whatever
Jafar really is up to must be baaaad [sic]." The officer noted that "[ajnother big hole is Jafar's
true name," and relayed that KSM's use of "another Abu name... Abu Arif... doesn't get us

far."^^^^ When KSM was confronted with the reporting he had provided on Jaffar al-Tayyar,
KSM claimed that he had been forced to lie about al-Tayyar because of the pressure he was
under from his CIA interrogators, who had been subjecting KSM to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques since his rendition to CIA custody.

Additional CIA records from this period indicate that, while KSM
claimed not to know Jaffar al-Tayyar's true name, KSM suggested that Jose Padilla, then in U.S.

military custody, would know his name. According to CIA records, the "FBI began participating
in the militaiy debriefmgs [of Jose Padilla] in March 2003, after KSM reported Padilla might
know the true name of a US-bound al-Qa'ida operative known at the time only as Jaffar al-

Tayyar. Padilla confirmed Jaffar al-Tayyar's true name as Adnan El Shukrijumah."-^^^
March 2003, a senior CTC officer noted differences between

KSM's reporting and reporting from Ramzi binal-Shibh.^Â®''^ In April 2003, an Intelligence
Community assessment concluded, based on comments from other detaineesâincluding those

In December 2005, an NCTC Red Team report, entitled "Ja'far al-

Tayyar: An Unlikely Al-Qa'ida Operational Threat," highlighted the possibility that the

information provided by KSM on al-Tayyar's capabilities and terrorist plotting was simply
deception. The report described alarge body of other detainee reportingâfrom Abu Faraj alLibi, Abu Talha al-Pakistani, 'Abd al-Rahim Ghulam Rabbani, and Ammar al-Baluchiâ

consisting of largely dismissive statements about Jaffar al-Tayyar's capabilities and role in alQa'ida.-"^-

inaccurate statements were then included in the final May 2004 Special Review.
Ihe
"Effectiveness" section of the Special Review was used repeatedly as evidence for the
effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, including in CIA representations

to the Department of Justice. The passage in the OIG Special Review that includes the
inaccurate CIA representation that KSM provided information helping to lead to the arrest of alMarri was referenced in the May 30, 2005, OLC memorandum analyzing the legality ofthe
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.The portion of the Special Review discussing alMarri has been declassified, as has the OLC memorandum.^Â®^^
The CIA also represented, in Pavitt's formal response to the OIG,

that prior to reporting from KSM, the CIA possessed "no concrete information" on al-Marri.2<^^^
The January 2004 draft OIG Special Review included the inaccurate information provided by
that
KSM "provided information that helped lead to the arrests of terrorists including... Saleh Ahnery, asleeper

This representation is incongruent with CIA records. CIA records indicate that prior to the
CIA's detention of KSM, the CIA possessed significant information on al-Marri, who was
an-ested after making attempts to contact a telephone number associated with al-Qa'ida member
and suspected 9/11 facilitator, Mustafa al-Hawsawi.-^^"^ CIA records indicate that al-Mam had

suspicious information on his computerupon his arrest,^^^^ that al-Marri's brother had travelled
to Afghanistan in 2001 to join in jihad against the United States,^Â®^^ and that al-Marri was
directly associated with KSM, as well as with al-Hawsawi.^Â®^^
The FBI also had extensive records on al-Marri. On Maich 26,

2002, a year before any reporting from KSM, the FBI provided the Committee with biographical
and derogatory information on al-Mani, including al-Marri's links to Mustafa al-Hawsawi,
suspicious information found on al-Marri's computer, and al-Marri's connections to other
extremists.

representations that prior to KSM's reporting, the CIA had "no concrete information" on al-Marri. The CIA's June

representations were based on the CIA's experience with one CIA detainee, Hassan Ghul. While
CIA records indicate that Hassan Ghul did provide information on Shkai, Pakistan, a review of
CIA records found that: (1) the vast majority of this information, including the identities,
activities, and locations of senior al-Qa'ida operatives in Shkai, was provided prior to Hassan

Ghul being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques; (2) CIA's HjjfjjlH
assessed that Ghul's reporting prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques contained sufficient detail to press the Pakistani
and (3)
tlie CIA assessed that the infonnation provided by Ghul corroborated earlier reporting that the
Shkai valley of Pakistan served as al-Qa'ida's command and control center after the group's

2001 exodus from Afghanistan.^Â®^^
As an example of one of the CIA's representations on Shkai,
Pakistan, and the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, on March 2,
2005, the CIA responded to a request from the OLC "for the intelligence the Agency obtained
from detainees who, before their inteiTogations, were not providing any information of
intelligence [value]." The resulting CIA memorandum, with the subject line "Effectiveness of
the CIA Counterterrorist Interrogation Techniques," included the following under the heading,
"Results":

"CIA's use of DOJ-approved enhanced interrogation techniques, as part of a
comprehensive interrogation approach, has enabled CIA to disnipt terrorist
plots, capture additional terrorists, and collect a high volume of critical
intelligence on al-Qa'ida. We believe that intelligence acquired from these
interrogations has been a key reason why al-Qa'ida has failed to launch a
spectaculai* attack in the West since 11 September 2001. Key intelligence
collected from HVD interrogations after applying inteiTogation

techniques:"^^^^
UNÂ¥) The CIA then listed "Shkai, Pakistan" as an example, stating:

"Shkai, Pakistan: The inteiTogation of Hassan Ghul provided detailed tactical
intelligence showing that Shkai, Pakistan was a major Al-Qa'ida hub in the
tribal areas. Through use of

Shkai was previously unknown to us or that Gul only told us about it after he was subjected to enhanced
interrogation techniques. We said that after these techniques were used, Gul provided 'detailed tactical
intelligence.' That intelligence differedsignificantly in granularity and operational utility from what he provided
before enhanced techniques." As described in this summary, CIA representations about intelligence on Shkai were
used as evidence of the necessity and effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. The CIA did
not inform policymakers or the Departmentof Justice about the extensive information provided by Hassan Ghul on
Shkai prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.

how he moved to Shkai due to concerns about Abu Musa'b al-Baluchi's contacts withlmH
how he traveled to Shkai to make contact with Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi, and how Abu

Faraj mediated between Ghul and Hamza Rabi'a.^Â®^^ Ghul stated that he last saw Abu Faraj in
the summer of 2003, when Ghul was seeking Abu Faraj's assistance in moving money from
Saudi Arabia to deliver to al-Hadi for support of their community in Shkai.
According to Hassan Ghul, Abd al-Hadi al-Ii'aqi moved
periodically among various houses within the village, including that of Abu Hussein and

whom he described as "seniormedia people for al-Qa'ida."^Â°^^ Elaborating on alHadi's location, Hassan Ghul described the importance of both a madrassa and a guesthouse in
Shkai known as the "bachelor house," where unaccompanied men stayed. Ghul stated that he
last saw al-Hadi in December 2003 when al-Hadi came to the "bachelor house" to visit with

other Arabs.Ghul also identified other permanent and transient residents of the "bachelor

house."^Â®^^ He stated that al-Hadi, who he believed was seeking another safehouse in Shkai at
which to hold meetings, had approximately 40 to 50 men under his command. Hassan Ghul also

al-Hadi would periodically receive brief handwritten messages from UBL via Abu Faraj, which he would share with
their group. Ghul stated that this did not necessarily mean that Abu Faraj knew the location of UBL, but rather tliat
he had a window into UBL's courier network. It was at this point that Hassan Ghul described the role of Abu

Hassan Ghul stated that in the late summer of 2003, al-Zarqawi made the request through Luay Muhammad Hajj
Bakr al-Saqa (aka Abu Hamza al-Suri, aka Abu Muhammad al-Turki, aka Ala' al-Din), but that al-Hadi had not

wanted to assist. According to Ghul, al-Hadi had previously sent Abdullah al-Kurdi to Iraq, but al-Kurdi did not
want to engage in any activities and was rumored to be "soft." This led al-Hadi to send Ghul to Iraq to speak with
al-Zarqawi regarding the possibility of select al-Qa'ida members traveling to Iraq to fight. According to the cable,

"Ghul claimed that the Arabs inWaziristan were tired, and wantedchai^," and that Ghul "was tasked toboth
discuss this issue with Zarqawi, and to recon the route." (See

an unspecified chemical weapon agent, al-Zarqawi's request to al-Hadi for walkie talkies, and al-Zarqawi's

Munthir, a Moroccan religious scholar who was a close friend of al-Zarqawi. Ghul identified another operative,

In addition to classified representations to the Committee, shortly after the operation targeting UBL on May 1,
2011, there were media reports indicatingthat theCIA's Detention and InteiTOgation Programhad produced "the
lead infonnation " that led to Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, the UBL compound, and/or the overall operation that led to
UBL's death. In an interview with Time Magazine, published May 4, 2011, Jose Rodriguez, the former CIA chief of
CTC, stated that: "Information provided by KSM and Abu Faraj al-Libbi about bin Laden's courier was the lead
information tliat eventually led to the location of [bin Laden's] compound and the operation that led to his death."

See "Ex-CIA CounterterrorChief: 'EnhancedInterrogation' Led U.S. to bin Laden." Time Magazine, May 4, 2011
(italics added). Former CIA Director Michael Hayden stated that: "What we got, the original lead informationâ
and frankly it was incomplete identity infomiation on the couriersâbegan with informationfrom CIA detainees at
the black sites" In another interview, Hayden stated: "...the lead information I referred to a few minutes ago did
come from CIA detainees, against whom enhanced interrogation techniques have been used" (italics added). See
Transcript from Scott Hennen Show,dated May 3, 2011, with former CIA Director Michael Hayden; and interview
with Fareed Zakaria, Fareed Zakaria GPS, CNN, May 8, 2011. See also "The Waterboarding Trail to bin Laden,"
by Michael Mukasey, WallStreet Journal, May 6, 2011. Former Attorney General Mukasey wrote: "Consider how
the intelligence that led to bin Laden came to hand. It began with a disclosure from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed

(KSM), who broke like a dam underthe pressure of harsh interrogation techniques that included waterboarding. He
loosed a torrent of informationâincluding eventually the nickname of a trusted courier of bin Laden." The CIA's

June 2013 Response confu-ms information in the Committee Study, stating: "Even after undergoing enhanced
techniques, KSM lied about Abu Ahmad, and Abu Faraj denied knowing him." The CIA's September 2012
"Lessons from the Hunt for Bin Ladin," (DTS #2012-3826) compiled by the CIA's Center for the Study of
Intelligence, indicates that the CIA sought to publicly attribute the UBL operation to detainee reporting months prior
to the execution of the operation. Under the heading, "The Public Roll-Out," the "Lessons from the Hunt for Bin

Ladin" document explains that the CIA's Office of Public Affairs was "formally brought into the [UBL] operation in

records indicate that: (1) the CIA had extensive reporting on

Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti (variant Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti),^^^^ the UBL facilitator whose
identification and tracking led to the identification of UBL's compound and the operation that
resulted in UBL's death, prior to and independent of information from CIA detainees; (2) the
most accurate information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti obtained from a CIA detainee was

provided by a CIA detainee who had not yet been subjected to the CIA's enhanced inteiTOgation
techniques; and (3) CIA detainees who were subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques withheld and fabricated information about Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti.
Within days of the raid on UBL's compound, CIA officials
represented that CIA detainees provided the "tipoffinformation on Abu Ahmad al-

Kuwaiti.^^"^^ A review of CIA records found that the initial intelligence obtained, as well as the

hunt and the operation," among other matters. The document details how, prior to the operation, "agreed-upon
language" was developed for three "vital points," the first of which was "the critical nature of detainee reporting in
identifying Bin Ladin's courier."
CIA documents and cables use various spellings, most frequently "Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti" and "Abu Ahmad

al-Kuwaiti." To the extent possible, the Study uses the spelling referenced in the CIA document being discussed.

detainees, and stated that "I want to be able to get back to you with specifics.. .But clearly the tipoff on the couriers
came from those interviews." The CIA's June 2013 Response states: "CIA has never represented that information
acquired tlirough its interrogations of detainees was either the first or tlie only information that we had on Abu
Ahmad." Former CIA Director Michael Hayden provided similar public statements. See transcript of Scott Hennen

The CIA's June 2013 Response states that the December 13, 2012, Committee Study "inconectly characterizes
the intelligence we had on Abu Alimad before acquiring information on him from detainees in CIA custody as
'critical.'" Tliis is incorrect. The Committee uses the CIA's own definition of what infonnation was important and
critical, as conveyed to the Committeeby the CIA. In documents and testimony to the Committee, the CIA
highlighted specific information on Abu Ahmadal-Kuwaiti that the CIA viewed as especially valuable or critical to
the identification and trackingof Abu Ahmadal-Kuwaiti. For example, in May 4, 2011, CIA testimony, a CIA
officer explained how "a couple of early detainees" "identi[fied]" Abu Alimed al-Kuwaiti as someone close to UBL.

The CIA officer stated: "I think the clearestway to think about this is, in 2002 a couple of early detainees, Abu
Zubaydah and an individual, Riyadh the Facilitator, talked about the activities of an Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. At this

point we don't have his true name. And they identify him as somebody involved with AQ and facilitation and some
potential ties to bin Ladin." As detailed in this summary, CIA recordsconfirm that Riyadh the Facilitatorprovided
information in 2002 closely linking al-Kuwaiti to UBL, but these records confirmthat this information was acquired
prior to Riyadh the Facilitatorbeing rendered to CIA custody (the transferoccurred more tlian a year later, in
January 2004). Abu Zubaydah provided no information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in 2002. According to CIA
records, Abu Zubaydah was not asked about Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti until July 7, 2003, when he denied knowing the
name. As an additional example, see CIA documents and charts provided to the Committee (DTS #2011-2004) and
described in this summary, in whichthe CIA ascribes value to specific intelligence acquiredon al-Kuwaiti.
In otlier words, the information the CIA cited was acquired from a detainee not in CIA custody, obtained from a
CIA detainee who was not subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, obtained from a CIA detainee
prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, or acquired from a source unrelated to detainee
reporting. As described, the information contained herein is based on a review of CIA Detention and Interrogation
Program records. Although the CIA has produced more than six million pages of material associated with CIA
detainees and the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, the Committee did not have direct access to other,
more traditional intelligencerecords, to includereporting from CIA HUMINTassets, foreign government assets,
electronic intercepts, military detainee debriefings, law enforcement derived information, and other methods of
collection. Based on the information found in theCIA detainee-related documents, it is likely there is significant

intelligence on "Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti" acquired from a variety of intelligence collection platforms that the
Committee did not have access to for this review.

signals intelligence indicating that Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti and Riyadh the Facilitator were in

phone contact with each other.^^^^ In August 2002, another detainee in thecustody of a
foreign government with known links to al-Kuwaiti^^^^âAbu Zubair al-Ha'iliâreported that
al-Kuwaiti "was one of a few close associates of Usama bin Ladin."^^^^ All of this
information was acquired in 2002, prior to any reporting on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti from
CIA detainees.^

Within a day of the UBL operation, the CIA began providing
classified briefings to Congress on the overall operation and the intelligence that led to the raid
and UBL's death.^^Â®^ On May 2, 2011, CIA officials, including CIA Deputy Director Michael
Morell, briefed the Committee. A second briefing occurred on May 4, 2011, when CIA Director
Leon Panetta and other CIA officials briefed both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
and the Senate Armed Services Committee. Both of these briefings indicated that CIA detainee

informationâand the CIA's enhanced inten'ogation techniquesâplayed a substantial role in
developing intelligence that led to the UBL operation. The testimony contained significant
inaccurate information.

(Â¥Sy^|||||||||mi|||||//NF) For example, in the May 2, 2011, briefing, the CIA informed the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that:

"However, there remained one primary line of investigation that was proving
the most difficult to run to ground, and that was the case of a courier named
Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Abu Ahmed had totally dropped off our radar in

The information above is not fully congruent with CIA records. As

detainees. Al-Kuwaiti was identified as early as 2002 as an al-Qa'ida member engaged in
operational planning who "traveled frequently" to see
No CIA detainee provided
reporting on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in 2002. While CIA detainees eventually did provide some
information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti beginning in the spring of 2003, the majority of the
accurate intelligence acquired on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti was collected outside of the CIA's
Detention and Interrogation Program, either from detainees not in CIA custody, or from other
intelligence sources and methods unrelated to detainees, to include human sources and foreign

partners.^^^^ The most accurate CIA detainee-related intelligence was obtained in early 2004,
from a CIA detainee who had not yet been subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation

techniques.^^^^ That detaineeâHassan Ghulâlisted Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti as one of three

security apparatus would be minimal, and that the group likely lived in a house with a family

the following statement to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Armed
Services Committee (which mirrored similar statements by a "senior administration official" in a

White House Press Briefing from May 2,2011)^^^^:
''The detainees in the post-9/11 period flagged for us that there were

As previously detailed, no CIA detainees provided information on
Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in 2002. As such, for the statement to be accurate, it can only be a

reference to detainees in foreign government custody who provided information in 2002.^^^^ As
noted, prior to any reporting from CIA detainees, the CIA was targeting Abu Ahmad al-

Kuwaitiâto include al-Kuwaiti's phone number and email address.-'^^ Further, prior to 2003,
the CIA possessed a body of intelligence reporting linking Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti to KSM and
UBL and to operational targeting of the United States, as well as reporting that Abu Ahmad al-

Kuwaiti was "one of a few close associates of Usama bin Ladin"^'^^ and "traveled frequently" to
"meet with Usama bin Ladin."^'^^

In the same May 4, 2011, briefing, a CIA officer elaborated on the
previously provided statements and provided additional detail on how "a couple of early
detainees" "identi[fied]" Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti as someone close to UBL:

"I think the clearest way to think about this is, in 2002 a couple of early
detainees, Abu Zubaydah and an individual, Riyadh the Facilitator, talked
about the activities of an Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. At this point we don't have
his true name. And they identify him as somebody involved with AQ and

Zubaydah discussing Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in 2002.^^^^ The first reference to Abu Zubaydah
As described in this summaiy, the CIA provided documents to the Committee indicating that individuals
detained in 2002 provided "Tier One" infomiationâhnking "Abu Ahmad to Bin Ladin." The document did not
state when the information was provided, or when the detainee entered CIA custody. Internal CIA records indicate
that no CIA detainee provided information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in 2002. See CIA six-page chart entitled,

Committee on May 5, 2011, tliat listed Riyadh the Facilitator as a detainee in "CIA custody," who was "detained
February 2002," and provided the referenced information. Tlie CIA document omitted that Riyadh the Facilitator
was not in CIA custody when he provided the referenced information in June 2002. Riyadh the Facilitator was not
rendered to CIA custody until January 2004. See Volume HI and DTS #2011-2004.
The CIA's June 2013 Response does not address the Committee Study finding that Abu Zubaydah did not
provide reporting on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in 2002. However, on October 25, 2013, the CIA responded in writing
that the December 13, 2012, Committee Study was correct, and confirmed that tlie "first report from Abu Zubaydah
discussing Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti was in 2003." (See DTS #2013-3152.) As described in the intelligence
chronology in Volume II, on June 13, 2002, the CIA's ALEC Station sent a cable requesting that Abu Zubaydah be
questioned regarding his knowledge of Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, whom the CIA believed was then in Pakistan.
Despite this request, CIA records indicate that Abu Zubaydali was not asked about Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti at this

time. (See ALEC ||||^| (130117Z JUN 02).) Days later, on June 18, 2002, Abu Zubaydah was placed in
isolation, without any questioning or contact. On August 4, 2002, the CIA resumed contact and immediately began
using the CIA's enhanced intenogation techniques against Abu Zubaydah, including the waterboaid. CIA records
indicate that Abu Zubaydah was not asked about Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti until July 7, 2003, when he denied

CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, but was collected by the CIA from other
intelligence sources, including from detainees in foreign government custody. Riyadh the
Facilitator provided substantial information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in 2002, including
information suggesting al-Kuwaiti may have served as a courier, as al-Kuwaiti reportedly

Consistent with the testimony, CIA records indicate that
the information provided by Riyadh the Facilitator was important information; however, Riyadh
the Facilitator was not in CIA custody in 2002, but was in the custody of a foreign

government.-^^^ Riyadh the Facilitator was not transfeiTcd to CIA custody until January |,
2004.^^^^ As noted, in 2002, the CIA received additional reporting from another detainee in the
custody of a foreign government, Abu Zubair al-Ha'ili, that "Ahmad al-Kuwaiti" was "one of a
few close associates of Usama bin Ladin."^'Â®^^

At the May 4, 2011, briefing, a Senator asked, "I guess what we're
trying to get at here, or certainly I am, was any of this information obtained through [enhanced]
interrogation measures?" A CIA officer replied:

"Senator, these individuals were in our program and were subject to some
form of enhanced interrogation. Because of the time involved and the

Below are specific details on the reporting of Abu Zubaydah, KSM, Khallad bin Attash, Ammar al-Baluchi, and
Abu Faraj al-Libi related to Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti: 1) Abu Zubaydali was captured on March 28, 2002, with a 27page address book that included a phone number for "Abu Ahmad K," which matched a
mobile
phone number that was already under intelligence collection by the U.S. Intelligence Community. (As early as July
2002, the CIA associated tlie phone number with al-Kuwaiti.) As detailed in the Study, Abu Zubaydah provided
significant intelligence, primarily to FBI special agents, from the time of his capture on March 28, 2002, through
June 18, 2002, when he was placed in isolation for 47 days. On June 13, 2002, less than a week before he was
placed in isolation, CIA Headquarters requested that interrogators ask Abu Zubaydah about his knowledge of Abu
Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, who was beheved to be in Pakistan, according to the request from CIA Headquarters. There are
no CIA records indicating tliat the intenogators asked Abu Zubaydah about al-Kuwaiti. Instead, as described, Abu
Zubaydah was placed in isolation beginning on June 18, 2002, with the FBI and CIA interrogators departing the
detention site. The FBI did not return. On August 4, 2002, CIA interrogators reestablished contact with Abu
Zubaydah and immediately began to subject Abu Zubaydah to the non-stop use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation

techniques for 17 days, which included at least 83 applications of the CIA's waterboard interrogation technique.
According to CIA records, Abu Zubaydah was not asked about Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti until July 7, 2003, when he
denied knowing the name. On April 27, 2004, Abu Zubaydah again stated that he did not recognize the name "Abu
Ahmed al-Kuwaiti." In August 2005, Abu Zubaydah speculated on an individual the CIA stated might be
"identifiable witli Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, aka Abu Ahmad al-Pakistani," but Abu Zubaydah stated the person in
question was not close with UBL. 2) KSM was captured on March 1, 2003, during a raid in Pakistan. An email
address associated with Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti was found on a laptop that was assessed to be associated with KSM.
Once rendered to CIA custody on March 2003, KSM was immediately subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques, which continued through March 25, 2003, and included at least 183 applications of the
CIA's waterboard inteiTogation technique. On Maich 5,2003, KSM provided information concerning a senior alQa'ida member named "Abu Klialid," whom KSM later called "Abu Alimad al-Baluchi." The infomiation KSM

provided could not be corroborated by other intelligence collected by the CIA, and KSM provided no further
information on the individual. On May 5, 2003, KSM provided his first information on an individual named "Abu
Alimed al-Kuwaiti" when he was confronted with reporting from a detainee not in CIA custody, Masran bin Arshad.
KSM confirmed bin Arshad's reporting regarding Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, specifically that bin Arshad was
originally tasked by KSM to get money from Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in Pakistan. KSM further relayed that Abu
Ahmad al-Kuwaiti worked with Hassan Ghul helping to move families from Afghanistan to Pakistan. On May 22,
2003, KSM was specifically asked about a UBL courier named Abu Ahmed. KSM again described a courier for
UBL whose name was Abu Ahmed al-Baluchi, but noted that this Abu Ahmed was more interested in earning
money than in serving al-Qa'ida. According to KSM, Abu Ahmed was working with Hassan Ghul in April or May
2002, but speculated that Abu Ahmed was in Iran as of early March 2003. In July 2003, KSM stated that Abu
Ahmad al-Kuwaiti worked with Abu Zubaydah's group prior to September 2001 and later with Abu Sulayman alJaza'iri. In September 2003, KSM was confronted with reporting from another detainee in foreign government
custody on Abu Alimad al-Kuwaiti. KSM confinned that he had told Hambali to work with Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti
as he transited Pakistan, but KSM downplayed al-Kuwaiti's importance, claiming to have contacted Abu Ahmad alKuwaiti only thiee to four times when he was in Peshawar and stating that Abu Ahmad worked "primarily with
lower level members" and appeared to have a higher status than he actually had in al-Qa'ida because KSM relied on

al-Kuwaiti for travel facilitation. In Januai^004^ase^i^tatement^nad^y Hassan Ghulâprovided prior tothe

use of the CIA's enhancedinterrogation techniquesâthat it was "well known" that UBL was always with alKuwaiti, CIA Headquartersasked CIA interrogators to reengage KSM on the relationship between al-Kuwaiti and
UBL, noting the "serious disconnect" between Ghul's reporting linking UBL and Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti and
KSM's "pithy" description of al-Kuwaiti. CIA Headquarters wrote that unlike Hassan Ghul, KSM had made "no

reference to a link between Abu Ahmed and al-Qa'ida's two top leaders" and that KSM "has someexplaining to do
about Abu Ahmed and his support to UBL and Zawaliii-i." On May 31, 2004, KSM claimed that al-Kuwaiti was

"not very senior, nor was he wanted," noting thatal-Kuwaiti could move about freely, and might be in Peshawar. In
August 2005, KSM stated that Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti was not a courier and that he had never heard of Abu Ahmad

transportingletters for UBL. Instead, KSM claimed that al-Kuwaiti was focusedon family after he married in 2002.
3) Khallad bin Attash was arrested with Ammar al-Baluchi in a unilateral operation by Pakistani authorities resulting
from criminal leads on April 29, 2003. On May
2003, he was renderedto CIA custody and immediately
subjected to the CIA's enhancedinterrogation techniques from May 16, 2003, to May 18, 2003, and then againfrom
July 18, 2003, to July 29, 2003. On June 30, 2003, bin Attash stated that al-Kuwaiti was admired among the men.
On July 27, 2003, bin Attash coiToborated intelligence reporting that al-Kuwaiti played a facilitation role in alQa'ida and that al-Kuwaiti departed Karachi to get married. In January 2004, bin Attash stated that al-Kuwaiti was
not close to UBL and not involved in al-Qa'ida operations, and that al-Kuwaiti was settling down with his wife in
the summer of 2003. In August 2005, bin Attash stated that Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti was not a courier, that he had

never heard of Abu Ahmad transportingletters for UBL, and that Abu Ahmad was instead focused on family after
he married in 2002. In August 2006, bin Attash reiterated that al-Kuwaiti was not a courier, but rather focused on

family life. 4) Ammar al-Baluchi was arrestedwith Khallad bin Attash in a unilateraloperation by Pakistani
authoritiesresulting from criminal leadson April29, 2003. Upon his arrest, Ammar al-Baluchi was cooperative and
provided information on a number of topics while in foreign government custody, including information on Abu
Ahmad al-Kuwaiti that the CIA disseminated prior to al-Baluchi being transferred to CIA custody on May
2003.
After Ammar al-Baluchi was transferred to CIA custody, the CIA subjected Ammar al-Baluchi to the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques from May 17,2003, to May 20, 2003. On May 19, 2003, al-Baluchi stated he
fabricated information while being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogationtechniques the previous day, but in
response to questioning, stated that he believed UBL was on tiie Pakistan/Afghanistan border and that a brother of
al-Kuwaiti was to take over courier duties for UBL. In June 2003, al-Baluchi stated that there were rumors that al-

Kuwaiti was a courier. In January 2004, al-Baluchi retracted previous reporting, stating that al-Kuwaiti was never a
courier and would not have direct contact with UBLor Ayman al-Zawahiri because "unlike someone like Abu Faraj,
[al-Kuwaiti] was too young and didn't have much experienceor credentials to be in that position." In May 2004, alBaluchi stated that al-Kuwaiti may have worked for Abu Faraj al-Libi. 5) Abu Faraj al-Libi was captured in
Pakistan on May 2, 2005. On May
2005, Abu Faraj al-Libi was rendered to CIA custody. Abu Faraj al-Libi was
subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques from May 28, 2005, to June 2, 2005, and again from June
17, 2005, to June 28, 2005. It was not until July 12,2005, that CIA Headquarters sent a set of "Tier Three
Requirements Regarding Abu Ahmad Al-Kuwaiti" to the detention site holding Abu Faraj al-Libi. Prior to this,
intenogators had focused their questioning of Abu Faraj on operational plans, as well as information on senior alQa'ida leadership, primarily HamzaRab'ia and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. On July 13, 2005, Abu Faraj al-Libidenied
knowledge of Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, or any of his aliases. On July 15, 2005,CIA Headquarters noted they did not
believe Abu Faraj was being truthful and requestedCIA debriefers confront Abu Faraj again regarding his
relationship with al-Kuwaiti. CIA records indicate that CIA debriefers did not respond to this request. On August
12, 2005, having received no response to its previous request, CIA Headquarters again asked Abu Faraj's debriefers
to readdress the issue of Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. CIA analysts noted that they "[found Faraj's] denials of even
recognizing his name difficult to believe," and suggested that "one possible reason why [Faraj] lied about not
recognizing Abu Ahmad's name] is [an attempt] to protect him - leading us to request that base readdress this issue
with [Faraj] on a priority basis." Two days later, on August 14, 2005, after being questioned again about Abu
Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, Abu Faraj al-Libi "swore to God" that he did not know al-Kuwaiti, or anybody who went by any
of his aliases, insisting he would never forget anybody who worked for him. Abu Faraj did suggest, however, that
an "Ahmad al-Pakistani" had worked with Marwan al-Jabbur to care for families in the Lahore, Pakistan, area, but

said he (Abu Faraj) had no relationshipwith this al-Pakistani. On August 17, 2005, CIA Headquarters requested
that debriefers reengage certain detainees on tlie role of Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. In response, KSM and Khallad bin
Attash claimed that al-Kuwaiti was not a courier and that they had never heard of Abu Ahmad transporting letters
for UBL. KSM and Khallad bin Attash claimed that al-Kuwaiti was focused on family after he married in 2002.

4, 2011, briefing, a Senator asked, "ofthe people that

you talked about as detainees that were interrogated, which of those were waterboarded and did

they provide unique intelligence in order to make this whole mission possible?"^^^^ CIA Director
Panetta responded:

"I want to be able to get back to you with specifics, but right now we think
there were about 12 detainees that were inter\newed,^^^^ and about three of
them were probably subject to the waterboarding processNow what came
from those interviews, how important was it, I really do want to stress the fact
that we had a lot of streams of intelligence here that kind of tipped us off there,
but we had imagery, we had assets on the ground, we had information that
came from a number of directions in order to piece this together. But clearly
the tipojf^^^ on the couriers camefrom those interviews
As previously detailed, the "tipoff' on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in
2002 did not come from the interrogation of CIA detainees and was obtained prior to any CIA
detainee reporting. The CIA was akeady targeting Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti and collecting
intelligence on at least one phone number and an email address associated with al-Kuwaiti in

2002.-^^^ No CIA detainee provided information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in 2002, and prior
to receiving any information from CIA detainees, the CIA possessed a body of intelligence
reporting linking Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti to KSM and UBL and to operational targeting of the
United States, as well as reporting that Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti was "one of a few close

CIA report states tliat Abu Faraj al-Libi identified an "Abu 'Abd al Khaliq Jan," as his "go-between witli Bin Ladin
since mid-2003," but there was no other CIA reporting to support this assertion. In May 2007, a CIA targeting study
concluded that the reporting from KSM and Abu Faraj al-Libi was "not credible," and "their attempts to downplay
Abu Ahmad's importance or deny knowledge of Abu Ahmad are likely part of an effort to withhold information on
UBL or his close associates." A September 28, 2007, CIA report concluded tliat "Abu Faraj was probably the last
detainee to maintain contact with UBLâpossibly through Abu Ahmad," but noted that "Abu Faraj vehemently
denied any knowledge of Abu Ahmad." See intelligence chronology in Volume 11 for additional details.

Italics added. CIA records indicate that none of the three CIA detainees known to have been subjected by the
CIA to the waterboard intenogation technique provided unique intelligence on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. To the
contrary, there is significant evidence that two of the three detaineesâAbu Zubaydah and KSMâfailed to provide
accurate information likely known to them about Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti and/or fabricated information to protect alKuwaiti. The diird CIA detainee known to have been subjected to the CIA's waterboard inten'ogation technique,
'Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, provided no information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. See intelligence cluonology in
Volume II for additional information.

The day after the classified briefing, on May 5, 2011, the CIA
provided the Committee with a six-page chart entitled, "Detainee Reporting on Abu Ahmad alKuwaiti," which accompanied a one-page document compiled by the CIA's CTC, entitled
"Background Detainee Information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti."-^^^ In total, the CIA chart
identifies 25 "mid-value and high-value detainees" who "discussed Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti's
long-time membership in al-Qa'ida and his historic role as courier for Usama Bin Ladin." The
25 detainees are divided into two categories. The chart prominently lists 12 detaineesâall
identified as having been in CIA custodyâ"who linked Abu Ahmad to Bin Ladin," which the
CIA labeled as the most important, "Tier 1" information. The document states that nine of the
12 (9/12: 75 percent) CIA detainees providing "Tier 1" information were subjected to the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques, and that of those nine detainees, two (2/9: 20 percent) were
subjected to the CIA's waterboard interrogation technique. The chart then includes a list of 13
detainees "who provided general information on Abu Ahmad," labeled as "Tier 2" information.
The CIA document states that four of the 13 (4/13: 30 percent) "Tier 2" detainees were in CIA
custody and that all four (4/4: 100 percent) "CIA detainees" were subjected to the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques.
On October 3, 2012, the CIA provided the Committee with a

above, Riyadh the Facilitator was eventually rendered into the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program in
January 2004, but CIA records indicate he was not subjected to the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques. Tlie
referenced information was provided in June 2002, while Riyadh the Facilitator was not in U.S. custody, but in the
custody of a foreign government.

Senator McCain and other members requested information on the use of tlie CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques in the UBL operation at the previous day's hearing and the CIA committed to provide additional
information to the members. Senator McCain: "I'm also interested in this whole issue of the 'enhanced

interrogation,' what role it played. Those who want to justify torture seem to have grabbed hold of this as some
justification for our gross violation of the GenevaConventions to which we are signatory. I'd be very interested in
having that issue clarified. I think it's really important." See transcript of the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence and the Senate Armed Services Committee briefing on May 4, 2011 (DTS #2011-2049).
See CIA letter to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence dated May 5,2011, which includes a document

entitled, "Background Detainee Information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti," with an accompanying six-page chart
entitled, "Detainee Reporting on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti" (DTS #2011-2004). See also a similar, but less detailed
CIA document entitled, "Detainee Reporting on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti's Historic Links to Usama Bin Laden."

The CIA's September 2012 "Lessons from the Hunt for Bin Ladin," compiled by the CIA's Center for the Study of
Intelligence (See DTS #2012-3826), appears to utilize the same inaccurate information, stating: "In sum, 25
detainees provided information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti,his al-Qa'ida membership, and his historic role as a
courier for Bin Ladin. Nine of the 25 were held by foreign governments. Of the 16 held in CIA custody, all but
three had given information after b&'mg subjectedto enhanced interrogation techniques (EITs), although of the 13
only two (KSM and Abu Zubaydah) had been waterboarded" (italics added). As described, tlie information in this
CIA "lessons" report is inaccurate.

CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence. The CIA Lessons Learned document states, "fi]n
sum, 25 detainees provided information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, his al-Qa'ida membership,
and his historic role as a courier for Bin Ladin." The CIA document then states that 16 of the 25

detainees who reported on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti were in CIA custody, and that "[o]f the 16
held in CIA custody, all but three [13] had given information after being subjected to enhanced
interrogation techniques (EITs)," before noting that "only two (KSM and Abu Zubaydah) had
been waterboarded."

A review of CIA records found that these CIA documents

contained inaccurate information and omitted important and material facts.

â¢

The May 5, 2011, CIA chart represents that all 12 detainees (12/12: 100 percent) providing

"Tier 1" intelligenceâinformation that "linked Abu Ahmad to Bin Ladin"^^^^âwere
detainees in CIA custody. A review of CIA records found that the CIA document omitted the
fact that five of the 12 listed detainees (5/12: 41 percent) provided intelligence on Abu
Ahmad al-Kuwaiti prior to entering CIA custody.
In addition, other detaineesânot in
CIA custodyâprovided information that "linked Abu Ahmad to Bin Ladin," but were not
included in the CIA list. For example, the first detainee-related information identified in CIA
records indicating a close relationship between UBL and Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti was
acquired in July 2002, from a detainee in the custody of a foreign government, Abu Zubair
al-Ha'ili (Zubair). According to CIA records, Zubair provided a detailed physical description
of Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, information on Abu Ahmad's family, his close connection to
KSM, and that "Ahmad al-Kuwaiti: was a one of a few close associates of Usama bin

Ladin.""^^'^ This information would be used to question other detainees, but was omitted in
the CIA's "Detainee Reporting on Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti" chart.
â¢

The May 5, 2011, CIA chart also states that nine of the 12 (9/12: 75 percent) "CIA
detainees" providing "Tier 1" intelligence were subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques. A review of CIA records found that of the nine detainees the CIA
identified as having been subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and
providing "Tier 1" information on links between Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti and UBL, five of
the 9 (5/9: 55 percent) provided information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti prior to being

subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.This information was omitted
from the CIA document. Of the remaining four detainees who did not provide information
on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti until
being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques, three were not substantially questioned on any topic prior to the CIA's use of

enhanced interrogation techniques.^^^ All three provided information the CIA assessed to be
fabricated and intentionally misleading.-^^^ The fourth, Abu Zubaydah, who was detained on
March 28, 2002, and subjected to tiie CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques in August
2002, to include tiie waterboard technique, did not provide information on Abu Ahmad alKuwaiti until August 25, 2005, intelligence that was described by CIA officers at the time as
"speculative."^-^^ These relevant details were omitted from the CIA documents.-^Â®^

information on Abu Ahmad," labeled as "Tier!" information, four of the 13 (4/13: 30

the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.A review of CIA records found the CIA
document omitted that two of the four (2/4; 50 percent) "CIA detainees" who were described
as subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques provided intelligence on Abu
Ahmad al-Kuwaiti prior to entering CIA custody, and therefore prior to being subjected to

the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.^-^^ Finally, there were additional detainees in

position for him to take but one that he has stuck with to this day. KSM initially downplays any role Abu Ahmed
might play, and by the time he leaves our program claims that he manied in 2002, retired and really was playing no
role." CIA records indicate Khallad bin Attash also downplayed the role of Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, stating several

foreign government custody "who provided general information on Abu Ahmad" that were
not included in the list of 13 detainees. For example, in January 2002, the CIA received
reporting from a detainee in the custody of a foreign government who provided a physical

description of a Kuwaiti named Abu Ahmad who attended a terrorist training camp.^^^^
The October 3, 2012, "Lessonsfor the Huntfor Bin Ladin" document states that "[i]n sum,
25 detainees provided information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, his al-Qa'ida membership,
and his historic role as a courierfor Bin Ladin." This is incorrect. As described, additional
detaineesânot in CIA custodyâprovided information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, including

being transferred to CIA custody.^^^"^

Zubaydah, who was detained on March 28, 2002, and subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques in August 2002, did not provide information on Abu Ahmad alKuwaiti until August 25, 2005, intelligence that, as noted, was described by CIA officers at

the time as "speculative,"-^-Â®
The October 3, 2012, "Lessonsfor the Huntfor Bin Ladin" document also states that "only
two [detainees] (KSMand Abu Zubaydah) had been waterboarded. Even so, KSM gave false
information about Abu Ahmad....
The CIA's May 5, 2011, Chart, "Reporting on Abu
Ahmad al-Kuwaiti," states that Abu Zubaydah and KSMprovided "Tier 1" intelligence that
"linked Abu Ahmad to Bin Ladin." CIA records indicate that both detainees denied any
significant connection between al-Kuwaiti and UBL. CIA records further indicate that Abu

Zubaydah and KSM, who were both subjected to the CIA's waterboard inten-ogation
technique, withheld information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti:

o

Abu Zubaydah: "Abu Ahmad K." and a phone number associated with Abu Ahmad
al-Kuwaiti was found on page 8 of a 27-page address book captured with Abu
Zubaydah on March 28, 2002. In July 2003, Abu Zubaydah stated that he was not
familiar with the name Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, or the description provided to him by
CIA officers. In April 2004, Abu Zubaydah again stated that he did not recognize the
name "Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti.According to a CIA cable, in August 2005, Abu
Zubaydah provided information on "an individual whose name he did not know, but
who might be identifiable with Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, aka Abu Ahmad alPakistani." According to the cable, Abu Zubaydah speculated that this individual
knew UBL and al-Zawahiri, but did not think their relationship would be close. Days
later a CIA cable elaborated that Abu Zubaydah had speculated on a family of

brothers from Karachi that may have included Abu Ahmad.^--^

times that Abu Ahmad was focused on family and was not close to UBL, and that he had never heard of Abu Ahmad
ai-Kuwaiti serving as a courier for UBL.

Abu Yasir ai-Jaza'iri provided conoborative information in July 2003 that Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti was
associated with KSM, was best known in Karachi, and appeared to be Pakistani. {See DIRECTOR
(111632Z JUL 03).) Samir al-Barq provided information in September 2003 that al-Kuwaiti had provided al-Barq

with $1000 to obtain a house in Karachi that al-Qa'ida could use for a biological weapons lab. {See
47409
(191324Z NOV 03), as well as the detainee reviewof Samir al-Barq in Volume ni that details al-Barq's various
statements on al-Qa'ida's ambition to establish a biological weapons program.) Neither of these reports is cited in
CIA records as providing unique or new information. In October 2003, both detainees denied having any
information on the use of Abbottabad as a safe haven for al-Qa'ida. See

KSM: When KSM was captured on March 1, 2003, an email address associated with
Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti was found on a laptop believed to be used by KSM. As
detailed in this review, KSM first acknowledged Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in May
2003, after being confronted with reporting on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti from a
detainee who was not in CIA custody. KSM provided various reports on Abu Ahmad
that the CIA described as "pithy." In August 2005, KSM claimed that al-Kuwaiti was
not a courier, and that he had never heard of Abu Ahmad transporting letters for
UBL. In May 2007, the CIA reported that the denials of KSM and another detainee,
combined with conflicting reporting from other detainees, added to the CIA's belief

that Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti was a significant figure.^^^"^
The CIA detainee who provided the most accurate "Tier 1"
information linking Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti to UBL, Hassan Ghul, provided the information

prior to being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.^^^^ Hassan Ghul was
captured on January

2004, by foreign authorities in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region.Ghul was

reportedly first inten'ogated by HHll, then transferred to U.S. military custody and
questioned, and then rendered to CIA custody at DETENTION SITE COBALT on January

2004.^-^^ From January

2004, to January

2004, Hassan Ghul was questioned by the CIA

at DETENTION SITE COBALT. During this period the CIA disseminated 21 intelligence
reports based on Ghul's reporting.A CIA officer told the CIA Office of Inspector General

As the dissemination of 21 intelligence reports suggests, information in CIA records indicates Hassan Ghul was
cooperative with CIA personnel prior to being subjected to the CIA's enhanced intenogation techniques. In an
interview with the CIA Office of Inspector General, a CIA officer familiar with Ghul stated, "He sang like a tweetie
bird. He opened up right away and was cooperative from the outset." {See December 2, 2004, interview with
[REDACTED], Chief, DO, CTC UBL Department,
) The CIA's September 2012
"Lessons from the Hunt for Bin Ladin," compiled by the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence (DTS #20123826), states that: "Ghul's tantalizing lead began a systematic but low profile effort to target and further identify
Abu Ahmad." On April 16, 2013, the Council on Foreign Relations hosted a fomm in relation to the screening of
the film, "Manhunt." Tlie foium included former CIA officer Nada Bakos, who states in the film that Hassan Ghul

provided tlie critical information on Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti to Kurdish officials prior to entering CIA custody.
When asked about the interrogation techniques used by the Kurds, Bakos stated: ".. .honestly, Hassan Ghul.. .when
he was being debriefed by the Kurdish government, he literally was sitting there having tea. He was in a safe house.
He wasn't locked up in a cell. He wasn't handcuffed to anything. He wasâhe was having a free flowing
conversation. And tliere'sâyou know, there's articles in Kurdish papers about sort of their interpretation of the
story and how forthcoming he was." See www.cfr.org/countertenorisra/film-screening-manhunt/p30560. When
asked by the Committee to comment on this narrative, tlie CIA wrote on October 25, 2013: "We liave not identified
any information in our holdings suggesting that Hassan Gul first provided information on Abu Ahmad wliile in
[foreign] custody."

that Hassan Ghiil "opened up right away and was cooperative from the outset."^-^^ During the
January
2004, to January
2004, sessions, Ghul was questioned on the location of UBL.
According to a cable, Ghul speculated that "UBL was likely living in Peshawar area," and that

"it was well known that [UBL] was always with Abu Ahmed [al-Kuwaiti]."^-^'^ Ghul described
Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti as UBL's "closest assistant"^-^^ and listed him as one of three

individuals likely to be with UBL.^-^^ Ghul further speculated that:
"UBL's security apparatus would be minimal, and that the group likely lived in
a House with a family somewhere in Pakistan. Ghul commented that after

UBL's bodyguard entourage was apprehended entering Pakistan following the
fall of Afghanistan, UBL likely has maintained a small security signature of
circa one or two persons. Ghul speculated that Abu Ahmed likely handled all
of UBL's needs, including moving messages out to Abu Faraj [al-Libi]...

The next day, Januai^ | , 2004, Hassan Ghul was transferred to
the CIA's DETENTION SITE BLACK.Upon arrival, Ghul was "shaved and barbered,
stripped, and placed in the standing position against the wall" with "his hands above his head"

for forty minutes.^^^^ The CIA interrogators at the detention site immediately requested
permission to use the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against Ghul, writing that, during
the forty minutes, Ghul did not provide any new information, did not show the fear that was
typical of other recent captures, and "was somewhat arrogant and self important." The CIA
interrogators wrote that they "judged" that Ghul "has the expectation that in U.S. hands, his

treatment will not be severe."^^^^ The request to CIA Headquarters to use the CIA's enhanced

See intelligence clironology in Volume 11. Tlie CIA's June 2013 Response states that "[a]fter undergoing
enhanced inteiTogation techniques," Hassan Ghul provided infonnation that became "more concrete and less
speculative, it also corroborated information from Ammar that Khalid Shaykh Muhammad (KSM) was lying when
he claimed Abu Ahmad left al-Qa'ida in 2002." The assertion in the CIA's June 2013 Response that information

acquired from Hassan Ghul "[ajfter undergoing enhanced interrogation techniques" "corroborated information from
Ammar that Klialid Shaykli Muhammad (KSM) was lying when he claimed Abu Ahmad left al-Qa'ida in 2002" is

incorrect. First, the referenced information from Hassan Ghu^a^cquire^rior to the use ofthe CIA's enhanced

intenogation techniques. ACIA cable, HEADQUARTERS

(|^|H| JAN 04), explains that based on

Hassan Ghul's comments that it was "well known" that UBL was always with al-Kuwaiti (acquired prior to the use
of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques), CIA Headquarters asked interrogators to reengage KSM on the
relationship between al-Kuwaiti and UBL, noting the "serious disconnect" between Hassan Ghul's comments and
KSM's "pithy" description of Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. The cable notes tliat KSM had made "no reference to a link
between Abu Ahmed and al-Qa'ida's two top leaders, nor has he liinted at all that Abu Ahmed was involved in the
facilitation of Zawahiri in/around Peshawar in February 2003," and that KSM "has some explaining to do about Abu
Ahmed and his support to UBL and Zawahiri." Second, as the intelligence chronology in Volume II details, there
was a significant body of intelligence well before Hassan Ghul's pre-enhanced intenogation techniques reporting in
January 2004 indicating that KSM was providing inaccurate information on Abu Alimad al-Kuwaiti. See detailed
information in Volume II intelligence clironology. Third, as detailed in CIA-provided documents (DTS #20112004), the CIA described Hassan Ghul's reporting as "speculat[ive]" both during and after the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques. Finally, as noted earlier, tlie CIA's June 2013 Response ignores or minimizes a
large body of intelligence reporting in CIA recordsâand documented in the Committee Studyâthat was acquired
from sources and methods unrelated to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. Nonetheless, the
CIA's June 2013 Response asserts: "It is impossible to know in hindsight whedier we could have obtained from
Ammar, Gul, and others the same information that helped us fmd Bin Ladin without using enhanced techniques, or
whetlier we eventually would have acquired other intelligence tliat allowed us to successfully pursue the Abu
Ahmad lead or some other lead witliout the infomiation we acquired from detainees in CIA custody" (italics added).
As detailed in this summary, the most accurate intelligence from a detainee on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti was acquired

prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, and CIA detainees subjected to the CIA's enhanced
inten'ogation techniques provided inaccurate and fabricated information on al-Kuwaiti. See detailed information in
the Volume II intelligence clironology.

that Hassan Ghul provided the detailed information linking Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti to UBL prior
to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was omitted from CIA documents and
testimony.

While CIA documents and testimony highlighted reporting that the
CIA claimed was obtained from CIA detaineesâand in some cases from CIA detainees

subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniquesâthe CIA internally noted that
reporting from CIA detaineesâspecifically CIA detainees subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniquesâwas insufficient, fabricated, and/or unreliable.
^ September 1, 2005, CIA report on the search for UBL states:

"Bin Ladin Couriers: Low-level couriers who wittingly or unwittingly facilitate
communications between Bin Ladin and his gatekeepers remain lai-gely

invisible to us until a detainee reveals them.-^"^^ Even then, detainees provide
few actionable leads, and we have to consider the possibility that they are
creating fictitious characters to distract us or to absolve themselves of direct
knowledge about Bin Ladin. We nonetheless continue the hunt for Abu
Ahmed al-Kuwaitiâan alleged courier between Bin Ladin and KSMâand

Abu 'Abd al Khaliq Jan, who[m] Abu Faraj identified as his go-between with
Bin Ladin since mid-2003, in order to get one step closer to Bin Ladin.
^

20, 2007, CIA "targeting study" for Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti

states:

"Khalid Shaykh Muhammad (KSM) described Abu Ahmad as a relatively
minorfigure and Abu Faraj al-Libi denied all knowledge ofAbu Ahmad.
Station assesses that KSM and Abu Faraj's reporting is not credible on this
topic, and their attempts to downplay Abu Ahmad's importance or deny
knowledge of Abu Ahmad are likely part of an effort to withhold information
on UBL or his close associates. These denials, combined with reporting from

other detainees^^"^^ indicating that Abu Ahmad worked closely with KSM and
Abu Faraj, add to our belief that Abu Ahmad is an HVT courier or
facilitator."-^"^^
See CIA letter to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence dated May 5, 2011, which includes a document

entitled, "Background DetaineeInformation on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti," with an accompanying six-page chart
entitled, "Detainee Reporting on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti" (DTS #2011-2004). See also a similar, but less detailed
CIA document entitled, "Detainee Reporting on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti's Historic Links to Usama Bin Laden."

Significantinformation was acquired on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti independent of CIA detainees. See intelligence
chronology in Volume II.

Additional CIA documents contrasted the lack of intelligence
obtained from CIA detainees subjected to the CIA's enhanced inten'ogation techniques with the
value of intelligence obtained from other sources. A November 23, 2007, CIA intelligence

product, "Al-Qa'ida Watch," with the title, "Probable Identification of Suspected Bin Ladin
Facilitator Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti," details how a:

"review of 2002 debriefings of a [foreign government] detainee who claimed
to have traveled in 2000 from Kuwait to Afghanistan with an 'Ahmad alKuwaiti' provided the breakthrough leading to the likely identification of
Habib al-Rahman as Abu Ahmad. The [foreign government] subsequently
informed [the CIA] that Habib al-Rahman currently is living in Pakistan,
probably in the greater Peshawar areaâaccording to our analysis of a body of

reporting."^^"^^
This CIA intelligence product highlighted how reporting from Abu

Faraj al-Libi, who was subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and denied
knowing Abu Ahmad, differed from that of Hassan Ghul, whoâprior to the application of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniquesâstated that "Bin Ladin was always with Abu Ahmad,"
and that Abu Ahmad had delivered a message to senior al-Qa'ida leaders in late 2003, "probably
through Abu Faraj." The document further states that KSM "has consistently maintained that

Abu Ahmad 'retired' from al-Qa'ida work in 200^' The CIA document states that the CIA will
be working with

government, as well as utilizing a database

information. FGiallad bin Attash was aiTCSted with Ammar al-Bakichi in a unihiteral operation by Pakistani

authorities resulting from criminal leads on April 29, 2003. On May
2003, bin Attash was rendered to CIA
custody and immediately subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques from May 16, 2003, to May 18,
2003, and then again from July 18, 2003, to July 29, 2003. On June 30,2003, bin Attash stated that al-Kuwaiti was
admired among the men. On July 27, 2003, bin Attash corroborated intelligence reporting that al-Kuwaiti played a
facilitation role in al-Qa'ida and that al-Kuwaiti departed Karachi to get manied. In Januaiy 2004, bin Attash stated
tliat al-Kuwaiti was not close to UBL and not involved in al-Qa'ida operations, and tiiat al-Kuwaiti was settling
down with his wife in the summer of 2003. In August 2005, bin Attash stated that Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti was not a
courier, that he had never heard of Abu Ahmad transporting letters for UBL, and that Abu Ahmad was instead

focused on family after he married in 2002. In August 2006, bin Attash reiterated that al-Kuwaiti was not a courier,
but rather focused on family life. Ammar al-Baluchi was anested with Khallad bin Attash in a unilateral operation
by Pakistani autliorities resulting from criminal leads on April 29, 2003. Upon his airest in Pakistan, Ammar alBaluclii was cooperative and provided information on a numberof topics to foreign government interrogators,
including informationon Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti that the CIA disseminated prior to al-Baluchi being transfen*ed to

CIA custody on May | , 2003. After Ammar al-Baluchi was transferred toCIA custody, the CIA subjected Ammar
al-Baluclii to the CIA's enhanced intenogation techniques from May 17, 2003, to May 20, 2003. On May 19, 2003,
al-Baluclii admitted to fabricating information while being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques
tlie previous day, and in response to questioning, stated tliat he believed UBL was on tlie Pakistan/Afghanistan
border and that a brother of al-Kuwaiti was to take over courier duties for UBL. In June 2003, al-Baluchi stated that

tiiere were rumors that al-Kuwaiti was a courier. In early 2004, al-Baluchi acknowledged that al-Kuwaiti may have
worked for Abu Faraj al-Libi, but stated that al-Kuwaiti was never a courier and would not have direct contact with
UBL. See intelligence chronology in Volume 11 and detainee reviews of Khallad bin Attash and Ammar al-Baluchi

CIA cable records from early 200^iighlight how the discovery
and exploitation of phone numbers associated with al-Kuwaiti^|[||||| had been critical in
collecting intelligence and locating the target,and state:

..debriefings of the senior most detainees who were involved in caringfor
bin Ladin have produced little locational information, and it is the final nugget
that detainees hold on to in debriefings (over threat info and even Zawahiri
LOCINT) given their loyalty to the al-Qa'ida leader. We assess that Abu
Ahmad would likely be in the same category as Khalid Shaykh Muhammad
and Abu Faraj al-Libi, so we advocate building as much of a targeting picture
of where and when Habib/Abu Ahmad travels to flesh out current leads to bin

Ladin."2250

May 1, 2008, a CIA Headquarters cable entitled, "targeting
efforts against suspected UBL facilitator Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti," documents that the CIA had a
number of collection platforms established to collect intelligence on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in
order to locate UBL. The cable closes by stating:

"although we want to refrain from addressing endgame strategies, HQS judges
that detaining Habib should be a last resort, since we have had no/no success in
eliciting actionable intelligence on bin Ladings location from any
detainees.

While the aforementioned CIA assessments highlight the
unreliability of reporting from senior al-Qa'ida leaders in CIA custody, specifically "that KSM
and Abu Faraj's reporting" was assessed to be "not credible"âand that their denials "add[ed] to
[the CIA's] belief that Abu Ahmad is an HVT courier or facilitator"^^^-âthe CIA assessments

also highlight that "reporting from other detainees indicating that Abu Ahmad worked closely
with KSM and Abu Faraj" was useful.--^^ As documented, the initial detainee-related
information linking Abu Ahmad to UBL and KSM did not come from CIA detainees, but from
detainees who were not in CIA custody

IV. Overview of CIA Representations to the Media While the Program Was
Classified

A. The CIA Provides Information on the Still-Classified Detention and Interrogation
Program to Journalists Who then Publish Classified Information; CIA Does Not File
Crimes Reports in Connection with the Stories

seeking to shape press reporting on the CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program, CIA officers and the CIA's Office of Public Affau's (OPA) provided
unattributed background information on the program to journalists for books, articles, and
broadcasts, including when the existence of the CIA's Detention and InteiTogation Program was
still classifiedWhen the journalists to whom the CIA had provided background information
published classified information, the CIA did not, as a matter of policy, submit crimes reports^
For example, as described in internal emails, the CIA's

never opened an investigation related to Ronald Kessler's book
The CIA at War, despite the inclusion of classified information, because "the book contained no

first time disclosures," andbecause "OPA provided assistance with the book."^^^^ SeniorDeputy
General Counsel John Rizzo wrote that the CIA made the determination because the CIA's

cooperation with Kessler had been"blessed" by the CIA director.-^^^ In another example, CIA
officers and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence raised concerns that an

article by Douglas Jehl in the New York Times contained significant classified information.^-^^

|CTC Legal wrote in an email that "part ofthis article was based on 'background'
provided by OPA. That, essentially, negates any use in making an unauthorized disclosure
[report]
Both the Kessler book and the Jehl article included inaccurate

claims about the effectiveness of CIA interrogations, much of it consistent with the inaccurate
information being provided by the CIA to policymakers at the time. For example, Kessler's
book stated that the FBI arrest of lyman Faris was "[bjased on information from the CIA's
On October 28, 2013, the CIA informed the Committee that "CIA pohcy is to conduct background briefings
using unclassified or declassified information" (DTS #2013-3152).

interrogations of
The Jehl article stated that a "secret program to transfer suspected
terrorists to foreign countries for interrogationhas been carried out by the Central Intelligence
Agency... according to current and former government officials." The article stated that a
"senior United States official" had "provid[ed] a detailed description of the program," and
quoted the official as claiming that "[t]he intelligence obtained by those rendered, detained and
interrogated ha[d] disrupted tenwist operations," The senior official added, "[ilt has saved lives
in the United States and abroad, and it has resulted in the capture of other terrorists.

B. Senior CIA Officials Discuss Need to "Put Out Our Story" to Shape Public and
Congressional Opinion Prior to the Full Committee Being Briefed
In early April 2005,
chief of ALEC Station,
asked CTC officers to compile information on the success of the CIA's Detention and

Interrogation Progran^ preparation for interviews ofCIA officers by Tom Brokaw of NBC
News.-^^- As
rcrnarked in a Sametime communication with Deputy CTC Director
Philip Mudd, during World War II, the Pentagon had an Office of War Information (OWI),
whereas the CIA's predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), did not.
then

noted that "we need an OWI, at least every now and then..
According to Mudd, concerns
within the CIA about defending the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program in the press were

misplaced:2264
"maybe people should know we're trying to sell their program, if they
complain, they should know that we're trying to protect our capability to
continue, we're not just out there to brag... they don't realize that we have
few options here, we either get out and sell, or we get hammered, which has
implications beyond the media, congress reads it, cuts our authorities, messes
The CIA at War, Ronald Kessler, St. Martin's Press, New York, 2003. As detailed elsewhere, lyman Paris was
already under investigation and Majid Khan, who was then in foreign government custody, had discussed Paris,
prior to any mention of Paris by KSM. Likewise, the capture of Khallad bin Attash in April 2003 was unrelated to
the reporting from KSM or any other CIA detainee. Kessler's book also stated that Abu Zubaydah "soon began
singing to the PBI and CIA about other planned plots," and that "intercepts and infomiation developed months
earlier after the arrest of Ramzi Binalshibh... allowed the CIA to trace [KSM]." {See Ronald Kessler, The CIA at

War, St. Martin's Press, New York, 2003.) As detailed elsewhere, Abu Zubaydah did not provide intelligence on alQa'ida "planned plots," and KSM's capture wasunrelated to information provided by Ramzi bin Al-Shibh. Pinally,
Kessler's book stated that KSM "told the CIA about a range of planned attacks - on U.S. convoys in Afghanistan,
nightclubs in Dubai, targets in Turkey, and an Israeli embassy in the Middle East. Within a few months the
hanscripts of his interrogations were four feet high." These statements were incongruent with CIA records.

Mudd counseled not to "advertise" the discussions between CIA

personnel and the media with the CIA "workforce," because "they'd misread it."2266

because it was sourced to the 9/11 Commission. They also determined that information about
lyman Paris and Sajid Badat that was sourced to press stories posed no legal problems because

Paris had already pled guilty and Badat was not being prosecuted in the United States.^-^^ On
April 15, 2005, a CIA officer expressed concerns in an email to several CIA attorneys about the
CIA releasing classified information to the media. There are no CIA records indicating a

however, Dateline NBC aired a program that included on-the-record quotes from Goss and
Mudd, as well as quotes from "top American intelligence officials.The program and
Dateline NBC's associated online articles included classified information about the capture and
interrogation of CIA detainees and quoted "senior U.S. intelligence analysts" stating that
intelligence obtained from CIA interrogations "approaches or surpasses any other intelligence on
the subject of al-Qaida and the construction of the network."^^^^ The Dateline NBC articles
stated that "Al-Qaida leaders suddenly found themselves bundled onto a CIA Gulfstream V or
Boeing 737 jet headed for long months of interrogation," and indicated that Abu Zubaydah,
KSM, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Abu Faraj al-Libi were "picked up and bundled off to
interrogation centers." The ardcles also stated that the capture of bin al-Shibh led to the captures
of KSM and Khallad bin Attash.^^^"^ This information was inaccurate.^^^^ There are no CIA
records to indicate that there was any investigation or crimes report submitted in connection with
the Dateline NBC program and its associated reporting.
C. CIA Attorneys Caution that Classified Information Provided to the Media Should Not
Be Attributed to the CIA

(^FS//||H||||H|||||^||||||/^^ After the April 15, 2005, National Security Council Principals
Committee meeting, the CIA drafted an extensive document describing the CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program for an anticipated media campaign. CIA attorneys, discussing aspects of
the campaign involving off-the-record disclosures, cautioned against attributing the information
to the CIA itself. One senior attorney stated that the proposed press briefing was "minimally
acceptable, but only if not attributed to a CIA official." The CIA attorney continued: "This
should be attributed to an 'official knowledgeable' about the program (or some similar
obfuscation), but should not be attributed to a CIA or intelligence official." Referring to CIA
efforts to deny Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for previously acknowledged

Committee, however, do not indicate White House approval for the subsequent media disclosures. In the summer of

D. The CIA Engages with Journalists and Conveys an Inaccurate Account of the
Interrogation of Abu Zubaydah
In late 2005, the CIA decided to cooperate again with Douglas Jehl
of the New York Times, despite his intention to publish information about the program. A CIA
officer wrote about Jehl's proposed article, which was largely about the CIA's detention and

interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, "[t]his is not necessarily an unflattering story."^^^^ Jehl, who
provided the CIA with a detailed outline of his proposed story, informed the CIA that he would
emphasize that the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques worked, that they were approved
through an inter-agency process, and that the CIA went to great lengths to ensure that the

interrogation program was authorized by the White House and the Department of Justice.^^^Â®

exploitation success.

While the New York Times did not publish Jehl's story, on
September 7, 2006, the day after President Bush publicly acknowledged the program, David
Johnston of the New York Times called the CIA's OPA with a proposed news story about the
interrogation of Abu Zubaydah. In an email with the subject line, "We Can't Let This Go
Unanswered," the CIA's director of public affairs in OPA, Mark Mansfield, described Johnston's
proposed narrative as "bullshit" and biased toward the FBI, adding that "we need to push

back."^^^^ While it is unclear if Mansfield responded to Johnston's proposed story, Mansfield
later wrote in an email that there was "[n]o need to woiTy."-^"^ On September 10, 2006, the New
York Times published an article by Johnston, entitled, "At a Secret Interrogation, Dispute Flared
Over Tactics," that described "sharply contrasting accounts" of the interrogation of Abu
Zubaydah. The article cited officials "more closely allied with law enforcement," who stated
that Abu Zubaydah "cooperated with F.B.I, interviewers," as well as officials "closely tied to
intelligence agencies," who stated that Abu Zubaydah "was lying, and things were going
nowhere," and that "[i]t was clear that he had information about an imminent attack and time

was of the essence." The article included the frequent CIA representation that, after the use of
"tougher tactics," Abu Zubaydah "soon began to provide information on key A1 Qaeda operators

to help us find and capaire those responsible for the 9/11 attacks."-^^^ This characterization of
Abu Zubaydah's interrogation is incongruent with CIA interrogation records.~^^^ CTC stated
that the article resulted in questions to the CIA from the country
and assessed that "[djisclosures of this nature could adversely [have

an] impact on future joint CT operations with... HH partners."^^*^^ There are no indications
that the CIA filed a crimes report in connection with the article."^Â®^^
In early 2007, the CIA cooperated with Ronald Kessler again on
another book. According to CIA records, the purpose of the cooperation was to "push back" on
Kessler's proposed accounts of intelligence related to the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the

then suggested that "if we are going to do this," the CIA could
provide information to Kessler that would "undercut the FBI agents," who
stated had
"leaked that they would have gotten everything anyway" from Abu Zubaydah.

After Kessler provided a draft of his book to the CIA and met with
CIA officers, the CIA's director of public affairs, Mark Mansfield, described what he viewed as
the problems in Kessler's narrative. According to Mansfield, Kessler was "vastly overstating the
FBI's role in thwarting terrorism and, frankly, giving other USG agenciesâincluding CIAâ
short shrift." Moreover, "[t]he draft also didn't reflect the enormously valuable intelligence the
USG gleaned from CIA's inten'ogation program" and "had unnamed FBI officers questioning
our methods and claiming their own way of eliciting information is much more effective."
According to Mansfield, the CIA "made some headway" in its meeting with Kessler and that, as
a result of the CIA's intervention, his book would be "more balanced than it would have
been."2293

in an email to Mansfield, Kessler provided the "substantive
changes" he had made to his draft following his meeting with CIA officials. The changes
included the statement that Abu Zubaydah was subjected to "coercive interrogation techniques"
after he "stopped cooperating." Kessler's revised text further stated that "the CIA could point to
a string of successes and dozens of plots that were rolled up because of coercive interrogation
techniques." The statements in the revised text on the "successes" attributable to the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques were similar to CIA representations to policymakers and were

incongruent with CIA records.^^^'^

based on CIA information and vetted by the CIA, that Abu Zubaydali and Ramzi bin al-Shibh "provided information
that would help in the planning and execution of the operation that captured Klialid Sheikh Mohammed." With
regard to the Second Wave plotting, Kessler stated that "'[ilf it had not been for coercive interrogation techniques
used on Abu Zubaydali, CIA officials suggest, the second wave of attacks might have occurred and KSM could be
free and planning more attacks." As detailed in this summary, and in greater detail in Volumes II and III, the
thwarting of the Second Wave plotting and the capture of KSM were unrelated to reporting from Abu Zubaydah.

Kessler's "substantive changes" made after his meeting with CIA
officials included the statement that many members of Congress and members of the media
"have made careers for themselves by belittling and undercutting the efforts of the heroic men
and women who are trying to protect us," Kessler's revised text contended that, "[wjithout

winning the war being waged by the media against our own government, we are going to lose the
war on terror because the tools that are needed will be taken away by a Congress swayed by a
misinformed public and by other countries unwilling to cooperate with the CIA or FBI because

they fear mindless exposure by the press." Finally, Kessler's changes, made after his meeting
with CIA officers, included the statement that "[t]oo many Americans are intent on demonizing
those who are trying to protect us.""^^^

Justice review of theCIA'sinterrogation techniques, and congressional oversight of the CIA'sDetention and

Interrogation Program. For example, Kessler wrote, "[bjefore confronting a teiTorist, each interrogator was given
250 hours ofspecialized training." This statement isincongruent with the history ofthe CIA program. Email from:

Review of CIA Representations to the Department of Justice

A. August 1, 2002, OLC Memorandum Relies onInaccurate Information Regarding Abu
Zubaydah

The office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of Justice

wrote several legal memoranda and letters on the legality ofthe CIA's Detention and
InteiTogation Program between 2002 and 2007. The OLC requested, and relied on, information

provided by the CIA to conduct the legal analysis included in these memoranda and letters.
Much of the information the CIA provided to the OLC was inaccurate in material respects.

On August 1,2002, the OLC issued a memorandum advising that
the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against Abu Zubaydah would not violate

prohibitions against torture found in Section 2340A of Title 18 of the United States Code.^^^^

The techniques were: (1) attention grasp, (2) walling, (3) facial hold, (4) facial slap (insult slap),
(5) cramped confinement, (6) wall standing, (7) stress positions, (8) sleep deprivation, (9) insects
placed in a confinement box, and (10) the waterboard. The memorandum relied on CIA
representations about Abu Zubaydah's status in al-Qa'ida, his role inal-Qa'ida plots, his
expertise in interrogation resistance training, and his withholding ofinformation on pending
terrorist attacks.-^^"^ The OLC memorandum included the following statement about OLC's
reliance on information provided by the CIA:

"Our advice is based upon the following facts, which you have provided to us.
We also understand that you do not have any facts in your possession contrary
to the facts outlined here, and this opinion is limited to these facts. If these
facts were to change, this advice would not necessarily apply

Tab 1). During a 2008 hearing ofdie Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, tlien-Acting Assistant Attorney
General Steven Bradbury stressed that the OLC's opinions relied on factual representations made by the CIA. As
Bradbury testified, "all ofour advice addressing the CIA's specific intenogation methods has made clear that OLC's

legal conclusions were contingent on a number ofexpress conditions, limitations and safeguards adopted by the CIA
and designed to ensure that the program would be administered by trained professionals witli strict oversight and
controls, and that none ofthe interrogation practices would go beyond the bounds ofthe law." When asked whether
information could be elicited from detainees using techniques authorized by the Army Field Manual, Bradbury

responded, "Iwill have to defer, because on those kinds of questions in terms of the effectiveness and the
information obtained I have torely on the professional judgment ofthe folks involved at the agency, and General
[Michael] Hayden I think has spoken to this issue before this Committee." (See transcript ofhearing ofthe Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence, June 10, 2008 (DTS #2008-2698).) General Hayden's representations to the

Committee are described elsewhere in this summar^n^r^reate^etaiUi^^ume II.

The facts provided by the CIA, and relied on by the OLC to
support its legal analysis, were cited in the August 1, 2002, memorandum, and many were
repeated in subsequent OLC memoranda on the CIA's enhanced inten'ogation techniques. Much
of the information provided by the CIA to the OLC was unsupported by CIA records. Examples
include:

â¢

Abu Zubaydah's Status in Al-Qa'ida: The OLC memorandum repeated the CIA's
representation that Abu Zubaydah was the "third or fourth man" in al-Qa'ida.^^^^ This
CIA assessment was based on single-source reporting that was recanted prior to the
August 1, 2002, OLC legaUnemorandum. This retraction was provided to several senior

CIA officers, including m^HCTC Legal, to whom the information was emailed on
July 10, 2002, three weeks prior to the issuance of the August 1, 2002, OLC

memorandum.^^Â°Â® The CIA laterconcluded that Abu Zubaydah was not a member of alQa'ida.^^Â®^
â¢

Abu Zubaydah's Role in Al-Qa 'ida Plots: The OLC memorandum repeated the CIA's
representation that Abu Zubaydah "has been involved in every major terrorist operation

carried out by al Qaeda,"--^^- and that Abu Zubaydah "was one of the planners of the
September 11 attacks.CIA records do not support these claims.
â¢

Abu Zubaydah's Expertise in Interrogation Resistance Training: The OLC memorandum
repeated the CIA's representation that Abu Zubaydah was "well-versed" in resistance to
interrogation techniques, and that "it is believed Zubaydah wrote al Qaeda's manual on

resistance techniques.""^^ A review of CIA records found no information to support
these claims. To the contrary, Abu Zubaydah later stated that it was his belief that all

Abu Zubaydah's Withholding ofInformation on Pending Terrorist Attacks: The OLC
memorandum repeated CIA representations stating that "the interrogation team is certain"
Abu Zubaydah was withholding information related to planned attacks against the United

States, either within the U.S. homeland or abroad.^^^ CIA records do not support this
claim. Abu Zubaydah's interrogation team was not "certain" that Abu Zubaydah was
withholding "critical threat information." To the contrary, the interrogation team wrote
to CIA Headquarters: "[o]ur assumption is the objective of this operation [the
interrogation of Abu Zubaydah] is to achieve a high degree of confidence that [Abu
Zubaydah] is not holding back actionable information concerning threats to the United

States beyond that which [Abu Zubaydah] has already provided."-^^^
B. The CIA Interprets the August 1, 2002, Memorandum to Apply to Other Detainees,
Despite Language of the Memorandum; Interrogations of Abu Zubaydah and Other
Detainees Diverge from the CIA's Representations to the OLC
The CIA broadly interpreted the August 1, 2002, OLC
memorandum to allow for greater operational latitude. For example, the memorandum stated
that the legal advice was specific to the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah and the specific CIA
representations about Abu Zubaydah; however, the CIA applied its enhanced inteiTogation
techniques to numerous other CIA detainees without seeking additional formal legal advice from
the OLC. As detailed elsewhere, the other detainees subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques varied significantly in terms of their assessed role in teiTorist activities
and the information they were believed to possess. CIA records indicate that it was not until July
29, 2003, almost a year later, that the attorney general stated that the legal principles of the

August 1, 2002, memorandum could be applied to other CIA detainees.^^^^
The August 1, 2002, OLC memorandum also included an analysis

CIA stated the techniques would be applied.-^^^ However, in the interrogations of Abu
Zubaydah and subsequent CIA detainees, the CIA applied the techniques in a manner that a
Department of Justice attorney concluded "was quite different from the [description] presented in

2002."-^'^ As reported by the CIA's inspector general, the CIA used the waterboarding
technique against Abu Zubaydah, and later against KSM, in a manner inconsistent with CIA
representations to the OLC, as well as the OLC's description of the technique in the August 1,
2002, memorandum. In addition, the CIA assured the OLC that it would be "unlikely" that CIA
detainees subjected to sleep deprivation would experience hallucinations, and that if they did,

medical personnel would intervene.^^^^ However, multiple CIA detainees subjected to prolonged
sleep deprivation experienced hallucinations, and CIA interrogation teams did not always

discontinue sleep deprivation after the detainees had experienced hallucinations.-^^^ The CIA
further represented to the OLC that Abu Zubaydah's recovery from his wound would not be
impeded by the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.However, prior to the
OLC memorandum, DETENTION SITE GREEN personnel stated, and CIA Headquarters had
confirmed, that the inten-ogation process would take precedence over preventing Abu
Zubaydah's wound from becoming infectedOther CIA detainees were also subjected to the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, notwithstanding concerns that the interrogation

techniques could exacerbate their injuries.^^^^ The CIA also repeatedly used intertogation
techniques beyond those provided to the OLC for review, including water dousing, nudity,

abdominal slaps, and dietary manipulation.^^

principals. Attorney General John Ashcroft expressed the view that "while appropriate caution
should be exercised in the number of times the waterboard was administered, the repetitions

Zubaydah's] interrogation, the combination of a lack of hygiene, sub-optimal nutrition, inadvertent trauma to the
wound secondary to some of the stress positions utilized at that stage and the removal of formal, obvious medical
care to further isolate the subject had an overall additive effect on the deterioration of the wound." See

do not indicate that the attorney general opined on the manner (as opposed to the frequency) with
which the waterboard was implemented, or on interrogation techniques not included in the
August 2002 opinion. The differences between the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, as
described by the CIA to the OLC in 2002, and the actual use of the techniques as described in the
CIA Inspector General May 2004 Special Review, prompted concerns at the Department of
Justice. On May 27, 2004, Assistant Attorney General Jack Goldsmith sent a letter to the CIA
general counsel stating that the Special Review "raises the possibility that, at least in some
instances and particularly early in the program, the actual practice may not have been congruent
with all of these assumptions and limitations." In particular. Goldsmith's letter highlighted the
statement in the Special Review that the use of the waterboard in SERE training was "so

different from subsequent Agency usage as to make it almost irrelevant."^^^^
C, Following Suspension of the Use of the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, the

Justice to provide the CIA with a "formal, written legal opinion, revalidating and modifying, as
appropriate, the guidance provided" in the August 1, 2002, memorandum. It also recommended
that, in the absence of such a written opinion, the DCI should direct that the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques "be implemented only within the pai'ameters that were mutually

understood by the Agency and DoJ on 1 August 2002."^^^^ After receiving the SpecialReview,
Assistant Attorney General Jack Goldsmith informed the CIA that the OLC had never formally
opined on whether the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques would meet constimtional
standards.On May 24, 2004, DCI Tenet, Deputy Director John McLaughlin, General
Counsel Scott Muller, and others met to discuss the Department of Justice's comments, after
which DCI Tenet directed that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, as well as

^

As described in this summary, on July 2, 2004, Attorney General
Ashcroft and Deputy Attorney General James Comey attended a meeting of select National
Security Council principals, the topic of which was the proposed CIA interrogation of Janat

Gul.-^^^ According to CIA records, the attorney general stated that the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques against Gul would be consistent with U.S. law and treaty
obhgations, although Ashcroft made an exception for the waterboard, which he stated required
further review, "primarily because of the view that the technique had been employed in a
different fashion than that which DOJ initially approved.On July 20, 2004, Ashcroft, along
with Patiick Philbin and Daniel Levin from the Department of Justice, attended a National
Security Council Principals Committee meeting at which Ashcroft stated that the use of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques described in the August 1, 2002, OLC memorandum,
with the exception of the waterboard, would not violate U.S. statutes, the U.S. Constitution, or
U.S. treaty obligations. The attorney general was then "directed" to prepare a written opinion
addressing the constitutional issues, and the CIA was directed to provide further information to

the Department of Justice with regard to the waterboard.^^-^ On July 22, 2004, Attorney General
Ashcroft sent a letter to Acting DCI John McLaughlin stating that nine interrogation techniques
(those addressed in the August 1, 2002, memorandum, with the exception of the waterboard) did
not violate the U.S. Constitution or any statute or U.S. treaty obligations, in the context of the

CIA interrogation of Janat Gul.^^-^
Oil July 30, 2004, anticipating the interrogation of Janat Gul, the
CIA provided the OLC for the first time a description of dietary manipulation, nudity, water
dousing, the abdominal slap, standing sleep deprivation, and the use of diapers, all of which the
CIA described as a "supplement" to the interrogation techniques outlined in the August 1, 2002,

memorandum.^^^^ The CIA's descriptions of the interrogation techniques were incongruent with
how the CIA had applied the techniques in practice. The CIA description of a minimum calorie
intake was incongruent with the history of the program, as no minimum calorie intake existed
prior to May 2004 and the March 2003 draft OMS guidelines allowed for food to be withheld for

The CIA represented to the OLC that nude detainees were "not wantonly
exposed to other detainees or detention facility staff," even though nude detainees at the CIA's
DETENTION SITE COBALT were "kept in a central area outside the interrogation room" and
were "walked around" by guards as a form of humiliation.The CIA's description of water
dousing made no mention of cold water immersion, which was used on CIA detainees and taught

in CIA interrogator training.^^^Â® The CIA representation describing a two-hour limit for the
shackling of detainees' hands above their heads is incongruent with records of CIA detainees
whose hands were shackled above their heads for extended periods, as well as the draft March

2003 OMS guidelines permitting such shackling for up to four hours.^^^^ The CIA further
represented to the OLC that the use of diapers was "for sanitation and hygiene purposes,"
whereas CIA records indicate that in some cases, a central "purpose" of diapers was "[t]o cause
humiliation" and "to induce a sense of helplessness.

August 13, 2004, CIA attorneys, medical officers, and other
personnel met with Department of Justice attorneys to discuss some of the techniques for which
the CIA was seeking approval, in particular sleep deprivation, water dousing, and the
waterboard. When asked about the possibility that detainees subjected to standing sleep
deprivation could suffer from edema, OMS doctors informed the Department of Justice attorneys
that it was not a problem as the CIA would "adjust shackles or [the] method of applying the
technique as necessary to prevent edema, as well as any chafing or over-tightness from the
shackles." With regard to water dousing, CIA officers represented that "water is at normal
temperature; CIA makes no effort to 'cool' the water before applying it." With respect to the
waterboard, CIA officers indicated that "each application could not last more than 40 seconds

these representations was incongment with the operational history of the CIA program.
//NF) On August 25, 2004, the CIA's Associate General Counsel

a letter to the OLC stating that Janat Gul, who had been rendered to CIA custody
on July
2004, had been subjected to the attention grasp, walling, facial hold, facial slap, wall
standing, stress positions, and sleep deprivation. The letter further stated that CIA interrogators
"assess Gul not to be cooperating, and to be using a sophisticated counterinterrogation sti'ategy,"
and that the further use of the same enhanced interrogation techniques would be "unlikely to
move Gul to cooperate absent concurrent use" of dietary manipulation, nudity, water dousing,
and the abdominal slap. The letter referenced the reporting from a CIA source,stating: "CIA

understan^that before his capmre, Gul had been working to facilitate a direct meeting between
the

CIA

source reporting on the pre-election threat and Abu Faraj [al-Libi]

himself."-^^^

The following day, August 26, 2004, Acting Assistant Attorney
General Daniel Levin informed CIA Acting General Counsel John Rizzo that the use of the four
additional interrogation techniques did not violate any U.S. statutes, the U.S. Constitution, or

U.S. treaty obligations. Levin's advice relied on the CIA's representations about Gul, including
that "there are no medical and psychological contraindications to the use of these techniques as

you plan to employ them on Gul."^^^^ Atthe time, CIA records indicated: (1) that standing sleep
deprivation had already caused significant swelling in Gul's legs; (2) that standing sleep
deprivation continued despite Gul's visual and auditory hallucinations and that Gul was "not

oriented to time or place";-^^^ (3) that CIA interrogators on-site did not believe that "escalation to

information"and (4) that CIA interrogators did not believe that Gul was "withholding
imminent threat information."^^^^

Levin's August 26, 2004, letter to Rizzo was based on the premise
that "[w]e understand that [Janat] Gul is a high-value al Qaeda operative who is believed to

possess information concerning an imminent terrorist threat to the United States."-^'^" Levin's
understanding was based on the CIA's representation that "Gul had been working to facilitate a

direct meeting between the

CIA BUI source reporting on the pre-election threat

and Abu Faraj [al-Libi]."^^'^^ This information laterproved to be inaccurate. As detailed
elsewhere in diis summary, the threat of a terrorist attack to precede the November 2004 U.S.
election was found to be based on a CIA source whose information was questioned by senior

CTC officials at the time."^"^^ The same CIA source admitted to fabricating the information after
a
in
October 2004.^^^^^ In November 2004, after the use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques on Janat Gul, CIA's chief of Base at DETENTION SITE BLACK,
where Janat Gul was interrogated, wrote that "describing [Gul] as 'highest ranking' gives him a
stature which is undeserved, overblown and misleading." The chief of Base added that "[sjtating

that [Gul] had 'long standing access to senior leaders in al-Qa'ida' is simply wrong."^^"^ In
December 2004, CIA officers concluded that Janat Gul was "not the link to senior AQ leaders

tliat [CIA Headquarters] said he was/is,"-^"^^ and in April 2005 CIA officers wrote that "[tjhere
simply is no 'smoking gun' that we can refer to that would justify our continued holding of

[Janat Gul]."^^^^
By April 2005, as the OLC neared completion of a new
memorandum analyzing the legality of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, the OLC
sought information from the CIA on "what [the CIA] got from Janat Gul, was it valuable, [and]
did it help anything...." The CIA did not immediately respond to this request, and the CIA's
Associate General Counsel

noted that DOJ personnel had "taken to calling

[him] daily" for additional information.^^'^^ Subsequently, on April 15,2005, the CIA informed

the OLC that "during most of Gul's debricfings, he has sought to minimize his knowledge of
extremist activities and has provided largely non-incriminating information about his
involvement in their networks.On May 10, 2005, the OLC issued a memorandum that
stated, "[yjou informed us that the CIA believed Gul had infonnation about al Qaeda's plans to
launch an attack within the Lfnited States... [olur conclusions depend on these assessments."

The OLC referenced l^l^l's August 25, 2004, letter on Gul and the pre-election threat.'^'^^ In
a May 30, 2005, memorandum, the OLC referred to Janat Gul as "representative of the high
value detainees on whom enhanced techniques have been, or might be used," and wrote that "the
CIA believed [that Janat Gul] had actionable intelligence concerning the pre-election threat to

the United States,"-^''" In the same memorandum, the OLC conveyed a new CIA representation
describing the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on Janat Gul, which
stated:

"Gul has provided information that has helped the CIA with validating one of
its key assets reporting on the pre-election threat."**^^'
There arc no indications in the memorandum that the CIA

informed the OLC that it had concluded that Gul had no information about the pre-election
threat, which was the basis on which the OLC had approved the use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques against Gul in the first place, or that CIA officers had determined that
Gul was "not the man we thought he was." In September 2004, the OLC advised the CIA that
the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani and
Sharif al-Masri was also legal, based on the CIA representations that the two detainees were alQa'ida operatives involved in the "operational planning" of the pre-election plot against the
United States.^^''- This CIA assessment was based on the same fabrications from the same CIA

D. May 2005 OLC Memoranda Rely on Inaccurate Representations from the CIA
Regarding the Interrogation Process, the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, and
the Effectiveness of the Techniques

4, 2005, Actin^Assistan^ttomey General Steven
Bradbury faxed to CIA Associate General Counsel
^
questions related to
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, in which Bradbury referenced medical journal
articles. The following day,
sent a letter to Bradbury stating that the CIA's responses
had been composed by the CIA's Office of Medical Services (OMS). The CIA response stated
that any lowering of the threshold of pain caused by sleep deprivation was "not germane" to the
program, because studies had only identified differences in sensitivity to heat, cold, and pressure,
and the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques "do not involve application of heat, cold,

pressure, any sharp objects (orindeed any objects at all)."^'^''^ With regard to the effectof sleep
deprivation on the experience of water dousing, the CIA response stated that "at the temperatures
of water we have recommended for the program the likelihood of induction of pain by water
dousing is very low under any circumstances, and not a phenomenon we have seen in detainees

subject to this technique."^^^^ In response to Bradbury's query as to when edema or shackling
would become painful as a result of standing sleep deprivation, the CIA responded, "[w]e have
not observed this phenomenon in the interrogations performed to date, and have no reason to
believe on theoretical grounds that edema or shackling would be more painful," provided the
shackles are maintained with "appropriate slack" and "interrogators follow medical officers'
recommendation to end standing sleep deprivation and use an alternate technique when the
medical officer judges that edema is significant in any way." The CIA response added that the
medical officers' reconmiendations "are always followed," and that "[d]etainees have not

complained about pain from edema." Much of this information was inaccurate.-^^^

Bradbury further inquired whether it was "possible to tell reliably
(e.g. from outward physical signs like grimaces) whether a detainee is experiencing severe pain.'
The CIA responded that "all pain is subjective, not objective,"
adding:
"Medical officers can monitor for evidence of condition or injury that most
people would consider painful, and can observe the individual for outward
displays and expressions associated with the experience of pain. Medical
officer [sic] can and do ask the subject, after the interrogation session has
concluded, if he is in pain, and have and do provide analgesics, such as Tylenol
and Aleve, to detainees who report headache and other discomforts during
their interrogations. We reiterate, that an interrogation session would be
stopped if, in the judgment of the interrogators or medical personnel, medical
attention was required."

As described elsewhere, multiple CIA detainees were subjected to
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques despite their medical conditions.
Bradbury's fax also inquired whether monitoring and safeguards
"will effectively avoid severe physical pain or suffering for detainees," which was a formulation
of the statutory definition of torture under consideration. Despite concerns from OMS that its
assessments could be used to support a legal review of the CIA's enhanced interrogation

techniques,^^^^ the CIA's response stated:

"[i]t is OMS's view that based on our limited experience and tiie extensive

(^::S^|||||||B||||^^|//NF) in May 2005, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven
Bradbury signed three memoranda that relied on information provided by the CIA that was
inconsistent with CIA's operational records. On May 10, 2005, Bradbury signed two
memoranda analyzing the statutory prohibition on torture with regard to the CIA's enhanced

inteiTogation techniques and to the use of the interrogation techniques in combination.^^^"^ On
May 30, 2005, Bradbury signed another memorandum examining U.S. obligations under the

Convention Against Torture.^^^^ The memoranda approved 13 techniques: (1) dietary
manipulation, (2) nudity, (3) attention grasp, (4) walling, (5) facial hold, (6) facial slap or insult
slap, (7) abdominal slap, (8) cramped confinement, (9) wall standing, (10) stress positions, (11)
water dousing, (12) sleep deprivation (more than 48 hours), and (13) the waterboard. The three
memoranda relied on numerous CIA representations that, as detailed elsewhere, were
incongruent with CIA records, including: (1) the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation techniques
would be used only when the interrogation team "considers them necessary because a detainee is
withholding important, actionable intelligence or there is insufficient time to try other
techniques," (2) the use of the techniques "is discontinued if the detainee is judged to be
consistently providing accurate intelligence or if he is no longer believed to have actionable
intelligence," (3) the "use of the techniques usually ends after just a few days when the detainee
begins participating," (4) the interrogation techniques "would not be used on a detainee not
reasonably thought to possess important, actionable intelligence that could not be obtained
otherwise," and (5) the interrogation process begins with "an open, non-threatening approach" to

discern if the CIA detainee would be cooperative.^^^^^

The OLC memoranda also relied on CIA representations regarding
specific interrogation techniques that were incongruent with the operational history of the
program. For example, the CIA informed the OLC that it maintained a 75 degree minimum
room temperature for nude detainees as "a matter of policy," with a minimum of 68 degrees in
the case of technical problems. This information was inconsistent with CIA practice both before

and after the CIA's representations to the OLC.^^^^ The OLC relied on the CIA representation
that standing sleep deprivation would be discontinued in the case of significant swelling of the
lower extremities (edema), whereas in practice the technique was repeatedly not stopped when

edema occuired.-^^^ The OLC also repeated CIA representations that constant light was
necessary for security, even though the CIA had subjected detainees to constant darkness.^^^^
Additional CIA representations accepted by the OLCâand found to be inconsistent with CIA
practice ârelated to; (1) the exposure of nude detainees to other detainees and detention facility

staff,^^^Â° (2) theuse of water dousingâspecifically the inaccurate representation that the
technique did not involve immersion, (3) the use of shacides in standing sleep deprivation, (4)
the likelihood of hallucinations during sleep deprivation, (5) the responsibility of medical
personnel to intervene when standing sleep deprivation results in hallucinations, and (6) the
purpose and the use of diapers on CIA detainees.

The OLC repeated the CIA's representations that "the effect of the
waterboard is to induce a sensation of drowning," that "the detainee experiences this sensation
even if he is aware that he is not actually drowning," and that "as far as can be determined, [Abu

doctors, is there any medical reason to believe they would have done so." The OLC fLirther
accepted that physical sensations associated with waterboarding, such as choking, "end when the

application ends."^^^^ This information is incongruent with CIArecords. According to CIA
records, Abu Zubaydah's waterboarding sessions "resulted in immediate fluid intake and
involuntary leg, chest and arm spasms" and "hysterical pleas.A medical officer who
oversaw the interrogation of KSM stated that the waterboard technique had evolved beyond the

"sensation of drowning" to what he described as a "series of near drownings."^^^"^ Physical
reactions to waterboarding did not necessarily end when the application of water was

He remained unresponsive after the waterboard was rotated upwards. Upon medical

medical, psychological and security standpoints).The CIA representations about training
and screening were incongnient with the operational history of the CIA program. CIA records
indicate that CIA officers and contractors who conducted CIA interrogations in 2002 did not
undergo any interrogation training. The first interrogator training course did not begin until
November 12, 2002, by which time at least 25 detainees had been taken into CIA custody
Numerous CIA interrogators and other CIA personnel associated with the program had either
suspected or documented personal and professional problems that raised questions about their
judgment and CIA employment. This group of officers included individuals who, among other
issues, had engaged in inappropriate detainee interrogations, had workplace anger management

issues, and had reportedly admitted to sexual assault.^^^^

Finally, the OLC accepted a definition of "High Value Detainee"
conveyed by the
that limited the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques to
"senior member[s]" of al-Qa'ida or an associated terrorist group who have "knowledge of
imminent terrorist threats" or "direct involvement in planning and preparing" terrorist actions.
However, at the time of the OLC opinion, the CIA had used its enhanced interrogation
techniques on CIA detainees who were found neither to have knowledge of imminent threats nor
to have been directly involved in planning or preparing terrorist actions. Some were not senior

al-Qa'ida members,^^^^ or even members of al-Qa'ida.^^^^ Others were never suspected of
having information on, or a role in, ten'orist plotting and were suspected only of having

information on the location of UBL or other al-Qa'ida figures,or weresimply^lieved to

have been present ata suspected al-Qa'ida guesthouse.^^^^ Ayear later, H^|^BCTC Legal
wrote to Acting Assistant Attorney General Steven Bradbui7 suggesting a new standard that
more closely reflected actual practice by allowing for the CIA detention and interrogation of
detainees to be based on the belief that the detainee had information that could assist in locating

senior al-Qa'ida leadership.-^^^ The OLC modified the standard in a memorandum dated July

The May 30, 2005, OLC memorandum analyzing U.S. obligations
under the Convention Against Torture relied heavily on CIA representations about the
intelligence obtained from the program. Many of these representations were provided in a
March 2, 2005, CIA memorandum known as the "Effectiveness Memo," in which the CIA

advised that the CIA program "works and the techniques are effective in producing foreign
intelligence." The "Effectiveness Memo" stated that "lw]e assess we would not have succeeded

further stated that "[pjrior to the use of enhanced techniques against skilled resistors [sic] like
KSM and Abu Zubaydahâthe two most prolific intelligence producers in our controlâCIA
acquired little threat information or significant actionable intelligence information." As
described in this summary, the key information provided by Abu Zubaydah that the CIA
attributed to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was provided prior to the use of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. KSM was subjected to CIA's enhanced inteiTogation
techniques within minutes of his questioning, and thus had no opportunity to divulge information
prior to their use. As described elsewhere, CIA personnel concluded the waterboard was not an
effective interrogation technique against
Under a section entitled, "Results," the CIA "Effectiveness Memo"

represented that the "CIA's use of DOJ-approved enhanced interrogation techniques, as part of a
comprehensive interrogation approach, has enabled CIA to disrupt terrorist plots, capture
additional terrorists, and collect a high volume of critical intelligence on al-Qa'ida." It then
listed 11 examples of "critical intelligence" acquired ''after applying enhanced interrogation
techniques":^^^^ the "Karachi Plot," the "Heathrow Plot," the "Second Wave," the "Guraba
Cell," "Issa al-Hindi," "Abu Talha al-Pakistani," "Hambali's Capture," "Jafaar al-Tayyar," the
"Dirty Bomb Plot," the "Shoe Bomber," and intelligence obtained on "Shkai, Pakistan." These
representations of "effectiveness" were almost entirely inaccurate and mirrored other inaccurate

information provided to the White House, Congress, and the CIA inspectorgeneral.^^^^ In
addition, on April 15, 2005, the CIA provided the OLC with an eight-page document endtled,
"Briefing Notes on the Value of Detainee Reporting." The CIA "Briefing Notes" document
repeats many of the same CIA representations in the "Effectiveness Memo," but added additional

inaccurate informationrelated to the capture of lyman Faris.^^^^
The OLC's May 30, 2005, memorandum relied on the CIA's
inaccurate representations in the "Effectiveness Memo" and the "Briefing Notes" document in
determining that the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques did not violate the Fifth
Amendment's prohibition on executive conduct that "shocks the conscience," indicating that this
analysis was a "highly context-specific and fact-dependent question." The OLC also linked its

analysis of whether the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was "constitutionally
arbitrary" to the representation by the CIA that its interrogation program produced "substantial
quantities of otherwise unavailable actionable intelligence.The CIA's representations to the
OLC that it obtained "otherwise unavailable actionable intelligence" from the use of the CIA's

enhanced interrogation techniques were inaccurate."^^^
The OLC memorandum repeated specific inaccurate CIA
representations, including that the waterboard was used against Abu Zubaydah and KSM "only
after it became clear that standard interrogation techniques were not working"; that the
information related to the "Guraba Cell" in Karachi was "otherwise unavailable actionable

intelligence"; that Janat Gul was a "high value detainee"; and that information provided by
Hassan Ghul regarding the al-Qa'ida presence in Shkai, Pakistan, was attributable to the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques.Citing CIA information, the OLC memorandum also
stated that Abu Zubaydah was al-Qa'ida's "third or fourth highest ranking member" and had
been involved "in every major terrorist operation carried out by al Qaeda," and that "again, once
enhanced techniques were employed," Abu Zubaydah "provided significant information on two
operatives... who planned to build and detonate a 'dirty bomb' in the Washington DC area."
The OLC repeated additional inaccurate information from the CIA related to KSM's reporting,
including representations about the "Second Wave" plotting, the Heathrow Airport plotting, and

the captures of Hambali, lyman Paris, and Sajid Badat.^^^^ The OLC relied on CIA
representations that the use of the CIA's enhanced inten*ogation techniques against 'Abd alRahim al-Nashiri produced "notable results as early as the first day," despite al-Nashiri providing
reporting on the same topics prior to entering CIA custody. The OLC also repeated inaccurate
CIA representations about statements reportedly made by Abu Zubaydah and

The OLC memorandum stated that "[b]oth KSM and Zubaydah had 'expressed their belief that the general US
population was 'weak,' lacked resilience, and would be unable to 'do what was necessary' to prevent the terrorists
from succeeding in their goals.'" As described elsewhere in this summary, and in more detail in the full Committee
Study, CIA records indicate that KSM and Abu Zubaydah did not make these statements. Tlie memorandum also
repeated CIA representations about KSM's comment, "Soon, you will know," and Abu Zubaydali's reported
statements about being "permitted by Allali" to provide infomiation. As described in this summary, these
representations are not supported by CIA records.

Finally, the May 30, 2005, OLC memorandum referenced the CIA

Inspector General May 2004 Special Review, stating; "we understand that interrogations have

regarding al Qaeda and its affiliates.The OLC memorandum cited pages in the Special
Review that included inaccurate information provided by CIA personnel to the CIA's OIG,

E. After Passage of the Detainee Treatment Act, OLC Issues Opinion on CIA Conditions of
Confinement, Withdraws Draft Opinion on the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation
Techniques After the U.S. Supreme Court Case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld
On December 19, 2005, anticipating the passage of the Detainee
Treatment Act, Acting CIA General Counsel John Rizzo requested that the OLC review whether
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, as well as the conditions of confinement at CIA

detention facilities, would violate the Detainee Treatment Act.-"^' In April 2006, attorneys at
OLC completed initial drafts of two legal memoranda addressing these questions.In June
2006, however, the U.S. Supreme Court case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld prompted the OLC to
withdraw its draft memorandum on the impact of the Detainee Treatment Act on the CIA's

enhanced interrogation techniques. As
Legal explained, the OLC would
prepare "a written opinion 'if we want'... but strongly implied we shouldn't seek it."-'^^-^ As
described in a July 2009 report of the Department of Justice Office of Professional
Responsibility, the Administration determined that, after the Hamdan decision, it would need

new legislation to support the continued use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.-'^"'^
Even as it withdrew its draft opinion on the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques, the OLC continued to analyze whether the CIA's conditions of
confinement violated the Detainee Treatment Act. To support this analysis, the CIA asserted to
the OLC that loud music and white noise, constant light, and 24-hour shackling were all for

upon intake and not as a "punitive step," that detainees were not exposed to an "extended period"
of white noise, and that CIA detainees had access to a wide array of amenities.^"^Â®^ This
information is incongruent with CIA records. Detainees were routinely shaved, sometimes as an
aid to interrogation; detainees who were "participating at an acceptable level" were permitted to

grow their hairand beards.^"^Â®^ The CIA had used music at decibels exceeding the
representations to the OLC. The CIA had also used specific music to signal to a detainee that

another interrogation was aboutto begin.-"^Â®^ Numerous CIA detainees were subjected to the
extended use of white noise.-"^Â®^ The CIA furdier inaccurately represented that "[mjedical
personnel will advise ending sleep deprivation in the event the detainee appears to be

experiencing hallucinations, transient or not."^"^Â®^ In a May 18, 2006, letter, j^^^HflCTC
Legal,
wrote to the Department of Justice that "some of these conditions
provide the additional benefit of setting a detention atmosphere conducive to continued
intelligence collection from the detainee." While the letter referred generally to "constant light
in the cells, use of white noise, use of shackles, hooding, and shaving/barbering," it described an
intelligence collection purpose only for shaving, which "allows interrogators a clear view of the
terrorist-detainee's facial clues."

August 31, 2006, the OLC finalized two legal analyses on the
conditions of confinement at CIA detention sites. The first was a memorandum that evaluated

whether six detention conditions in the CIA's detention program were consistent with the

Detainee TreatmentAct.^"^^' The second, provided in the form of a letter, concluded that those
same six conditions did not violate the requirements of Common Article 3 of the Geneva

Conventions.-"^^- The OLC relied on the CIA's representations related to conditions of
confinement for its analysis.-'^^-^ The OLC wrote that "underlying our analysis of all these
methods [conditions of confinement] is our understanding that the CIA provides regular and
thorough medical and psychological care to the detainees in its custody.As detailed in this
summary, the lack of emergency medical care for CIA detainees was a significant challenge for
the CIA.-^^^

(^^S/^IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIH/^^) The August 31, 2006, OLC memorandum applying the terms of the
Detainee Treatment Act to the conditions of confinement at CIA detention facilities stated that

"over the history of the program, the CIA has detained a total of 96 individuals." This was based

on a representation made by H|B||CTC Legal on April 23, 2006.^"^^^ As ofthe date ofthe
OLC memorandum, the CIA had detained at least 118 individuals. The OLC memorandum also

stated that "we understand that, once the CIA assesses that a detainee no longer possesses
significant intelligence value, the CIA seeks to move the detainee into alternative detention
arrangements." CIA records indicate that detainees had remained in CIA custody long after the
CIA had determined that they no longer possessed significant intelligence. Finally, the OLC
memorandum repeated a number of earlier inaccurate CIA representations on the effectiveness of
the program, citing both the CIA's "Effectiveness Memo" and its own May 30, 2005,
memorandum. Notably, the August 31, 2006, OLC memorandum repeated the same inaccurate
representation, which first appeared in an August 2002 OLC memorandum, that Abu Zubaydah
was al-Qa'ida's "third or fourth highest ranking member" and had been involved "in every major
terrorist operation carried out by al Qaeda." As described, CIA records as early as 2002 did not
support these representations, and two weeks prior to the issuance of the August 2006
memorandum, the CIA had published an intelligence assessment stating that Abu Zubaydah had
been rejected by al-Qa'ida and explaining how the CIA had come to "miscast Abu Zubaydah as a
'senior al-Qa'ida lieutenant.'"^"^^^

Letter for John Rizzo, Acting General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, from Steven G. Bradbury, Acting
Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, August 31, 2006 (DTS #2009-1810, Tab 12).
The OLC did not apply the Detainee Treatment Act or Common Article 3 to the use of shaving or other
conditions of confinement in tenns of their use as an interrogation technique. The OLC stated that while "the

primary purpose of the conditions of confinement we consider here is to maintain the security of the CIA's detention
facilities... [m]any of these conditions may also ease the obtaining of crucial intelligence information from the
detainees." Nonetheless, the OLC concluded that "the security rationale alone is sufficient to justify each of the
conditions of confinement in question." See memorandum for John Rizzo, Acting General Counsel, Central

Intelligence Agency, from Steven G. Bradbury, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, August

F. July 2007 OLC Memorandum Relies on Inaccurate CIA Representations Regarding CIA
Interrogations and the Effectiveness of the CIA's Enhanced Interrogation Techniques;
CIA Misrepresents Congressional Views to the Department of Justice
(U) On July 20, 2007, the OLC issued a memorandum applying the War Crimes Act, the
Detainee Treatment Act, and Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions to the CIA's

enhanced interrogation techniques. The memorandum noted that, while the Hamdan decision
"was contrary to the President's prior determination that Common Article 3 does not apply to an
armed conflict across national boundaries with an international terrorist organization such as al
Qaeda," this challenge to the CIA program was resolved by the Military Commissions Act,
which "left responsibility for interpreting the meaning and application of Common Article 3,
except for the grave breaches defined in the amended War Crimes Act, to the President.
The OLC memorandum determined that six proposed interrogation
techniques were legal: dietary manipulation, extended sleep deprivation, the facial hold, the
attention grasp, the abdominal slap, and the insult (or facial) slap. The memorandum accepted
the CIA's representation that, over the life of the program, the CIA had detained 98 individuals,
of whom 30 had been subjected to the CIA's enhanced inten'ogation techniques.At the time
of the OLC memorandum the CIA had detained at least 119 individuals, of whom at least 38 had

been subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniqueThe inaccurate statistics
provided by the CIA to the OLC were used to support OLC's conclusion that the program was
"proportionate to the government interest involved," as required by the "shocks the conscience"
test. The OLC also noted that "careful screening procedures are in place to ensure that enhanced
techniques will be used only in the interrogations of agents or members of al Qaeda or its
affiliates who tire reasonably believed to possess critical intelligence that can be used to prevent

future terrorist attacks against the United States and its interests."^"^^^ In practice, numerous
individuals had been detained by the CIA and subjected to the CIA's enhanced inten"ogation

The CIA's assessment of Ghailani's knowledge of terrorist threats was speculative. As one official noted,
"[ajlthough Ghailani's role in operational planning is unclear, his respected role in al-Qa'ida and presence in Shkai

The July 20, 2007, OLC memorandum also stated that the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques "are not the first option for CIA interrogators confronted even

with a high value detainee."^"^^^ As described in this summary, numerous CIA detainees were
subjected to the CIA's enhanced or "standard" inten*ogation techniques on their first day of CIA
custodywhile other detainees provided significant information prior to the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques. The OLC memorandum also accepted the CIA
representation that "[t]he CIA generally does not ask questions during the administration of the
techniques to which the CIA does not akeady know the answers," that the CIA "asks for already
known information" during the administration of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques,
and that when CIA personnel believe a detainee will cooperate, "the CIA would discontinue use
of the techniques and debrief the detainee regarding matters on which the CIA is not definitely
informed." As the memorandum concluded, "[t]his approach highlights the intended
psychological effects of the techniques and reduces the ability of the detainee to provide false
information solely as a means to discontinue their application.This description of the
program was inaccurate. As described in this summary, and in more detail in the full Committee
Study, CIA inten'ogators always questioned detainees during the application of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques seeking new information to which the CIA did not have
answers, and numerous detainees fabricated information while being subjected to the
inten'ogation techniques.
The July 20, 2007, OLC memorandum repeated CIA
representations that "many, if not all, of those 30 detainees" who had been subjected to CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques received counterinterrogation training, and that "al Qaeda
operatives believe that they are morally pennitted to reveal information once they have reached a

certain limit of discomfort."^"^-^"^ Neither of theserepresentations is supported by CIA records.

0^)-) Without receiving a response, they continued to subject Ibrahim to the

CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. CIA Headquarters, which rejected an assessment from two debriefers that
Ibrahim was, "at best... a low-level facilitator," would later indicate tliat it was "uncertain" he would meet the

requirements for U.S. military or

detention. See HEADQUARTERS jfjBlil IHHIIHHHI'

HEADQUARTERS

The OLC further stated that "enhanced techniques would be used only as less harsh techniques fail or as
interrogators ran out of time in the face of an imminent threat, so that it would be unlikely that a detainee would be
subjected to more duress than is reasonably necessaj-y to elicit the infomiation sought." See Memorandum for John
A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, from Steven G. Bradbury, Principal Deputy
Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, July 20, 2007, Re: Application of the War Crimes Act, the

The memorandum also repeated CIA representations that

inten-ogators were "highly trained in carrying out the techniques," and "psychologically screened
to minimize the risk that an interrogator might misuse any technique." These presumptions were
central to the OLC's determination that the limitations on interrogations contained in the Army
Field Manual were not "dispositive evidence" that the CIA's interrogation program fell outside
"traditional executive behavior and contemporary practice," an analysis required as part of the
substantive due process inquiry. Specifically, the OLC distinguished U.S. military interrogations
from the CIA program by stating that the CIA program "will be administered only by trained and
experienced interrogators who in turn will apply the techniques only to a subset of high value
detainees.As described in this summary, and in greater detail in the full Committee Study,
the CIA's representations to the OLC were incongruent with the history of the CIA's Detention
and Interrogation Program with regard to the training, screening, and experience of interrogators,
and the detainees against whom the CIA used its enhanced interrogation techniques.
The July 2007 OLC memorandum based its legal analysis related
to the six interrogation techniques under consideration on CIA representations that were
incongruent with the operational history of the program. In reviewing whether standing sleep
deprivation was consistent with the War Crimes Act, the OLC noted that its understanding that
the technique would be discontinued "should any hallucinations or significant declines in
cognitive functioning be observed" was "crucial to our analysis." The memorandum repeated
CIA representations that diapers employed during standing sleep deprivation "are used solely for
sanitary and health reasons and not to humiliate the detainee," and that, more generally, "[t]he
techniques are not intended to humiliate or to degrade.The OLC's understanding, which, as
described, was not consistent with the operational history of the CIA program, was part of its
analysis related to the prohibition on "outrages upon personal dignity" under Common Article 3.
As in the May 30, 2005 OLC memorandum, the July 20, 2007,
OLC memorandum conducted an analysis of the "shocks the conscience" test under the Fifth

Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, emphasizing the fact-specific nature of the analysis. Citing
both the CIA's March 2005 "Effectiveness Memo" and the president's September 6, 2006,
speech describing the interrogation program, the July 2007 OLC memorandum repeated the CIA
assertion that the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques produced "otherwise unavailable
intelligence." It also repeated CIA representations related to KSM's reporting on the "Second
Wave" plotting and Abu Zubaydah's reporting on Jose Padilla, both of which were

inten-ogation techniques had "revealed plots to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge and to release mass

biological agents in our Nation's largest cities."^'^^^
f/NÂ¥) Finally, the July 20, 2007, OLC memorandum assertedâbased on
CIA representations- -that members of Congress supported the CIA interrogation program, and
that, by subsequently voting for the Military Commissions Act, those members effectively
endorsed an interpretation of the Act that would be consistent with the continued use of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. This interpretation of congressional intent also
supported the OLC's constitutional analysis, which stated that there could be "little doubt" that
the Act "reflected an endorsement" from Congress that the CIA program "was consistent with

contemporary practice, and therefore did not shock the conscience."^'^^^ Specifically, the OLC
memorandum noted that according to CIA representations, prior to the passage of the Military
Commissions Act, "several Members of Congress, including the full memberships of the House
and Senate Intelligence Committees and Senator McCain, were briefed by General Michael
Hayden, director of the CIA, on the six techniques," and that "in those classified and private
conversations, none of the Members expressed the view that the CIA interrogation program

should be stopped, or that the techniques at issue were inappropriate."-'^ This representation
was inaccurate. For example, according to CIA records, during a briefing on September 11,
2006, Senator John McCain informed the CIA that he believed the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques, including sleep deprivation and the waterboard, were "torture.On September

Tliis is a reference to the CIA's representation that KSM, "as a result of EITs," provided critical and unique
reporting on lyman Paris and Majid Klian. As described briefly in tliis summary, and in greater detail in tlie full
Committee Study, lyman Paris was already under investigation, and Majid Khan was already in custody, before
KSM mentioned them. Khan himself revealed a discussion about poisoning reservoirs prior to his rendition to CIA

custody. (See ALEC jjjjl^B (210015Z MAR 03).) When Paris, who was likewise not in CIA custody, discussed a
plot against the Brooklyn Bridge, the former chief of CTC's Bin Ladin Unit described it as "half-baked," and "more

VI. Review of CIA Representations to the Congress
A. After Memorandum of Notification, the CIA Disavows Torture and Assures the

Committee Will Be Notified of Every Individual Detained by the CIA
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the signing
of the September 17, 2001, Memorandum of Notification (MON), the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence ("the Committee") held a series of hearings and briefings on CIA covert actions,
including the new authority to detain terrorists. At a November 13, 2001, briefing for Committee
staff,
Legal,
described the CIA's new detention authorities
as "terrifying" and expressed the CIA's intent to "find a cadre of people who know how to run

prisons, because we don't."^"^^ Deputy Director of Operations (DDO) James Pavitt assured the
Committee that it would be informed of each individual who entered CIA custody. Pavitt
disavowed the use of torture against detainees while stating that the boundaries on the use of
interrogation techniques were uncertainâspecifically in the case of having to identify the
location of a hidden nuclear weapon.
meetings with the CIA in Februai^ 2002, the month before the

capture and detention of Abu Zubaydah, Committee staff exprcssed^ncern about the lack of

any legal review ofthe CIA's new detention authorities. mHHI noted that the discussion
with Committee staff was "tiie only peer review" the CIA lawyers had engaged in with regard to
the MON audiorities, and that the discussion helped refine the CIA's understanding of what

MON-authorized activity was in fact legally permissible and appropriate.^"^"^^

On April 18, 2002, the CIA informed the Committee that it "has no

current plans to develop a detention facility."^"^^ At the time of this representation, the CIA had

already established a CIA detention site in Country | and detained Abu Zubaydah there. On
April 24, 2002, the CIA notified the Committee about the capture of Abu Zubaydah with the
understanding that the location of Abu Zubaydah's detention was among the "red lines" not to be

divulged to the Committee.^'^''^ The notification and subsequent information provided to the

Committee included representations that Abu Zubaydah was a "member of Bin Ladin's inner

circle" and a "key al-Qa'ida lieutenant."^'^''^ These representations were inaccurate. Briefings to
the Committee in the spring of 2002 emphasized the expertise of FBI and CIA interrogators
engaged in the Abu Zubaydah interrogations and provided no indication that coercive techniques
were being used or considered, or that there was significant disagreement between the CIA and
the FBI on proposed interrogation approaches.In early August 2002, after the Department of
Justice determined that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah
would be legal, the CIA considered briefing the Committee on the CIA's interrogation

techniques, but did not.^'^^'^

(Â¥8/^||^^mi|[||||||m//NF) In early September 2002, the CIA briefed the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI)leadership about the CIA's enhanced interrogation

techniques. Two days after, the CIA's ^^^|CTC Legal,

excised from a

draft memorandum memorializing the briefing indications that the HPSCI leadership questioned
the legality of the program by deleting the sentence: "HPSCI attendees also questioned the

legality of these techniques if other countries would use them."^"^^"^ After

copied Jose Rodriguez on the email in which he transmitted the changes to the memorandum,

Rodriguez responded to

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Bob Graham and Vice Chairman Richard
Shelbyâand their staff directorsâoccurred on September 27, 2002, nearly two months after the
CIA first began subjecting Abu Zubaydah to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. The
only record of the briefing is a one-paragraph CIA memorandum stating that the briefing
occurred.The Committee does not have its own records of this briefing.
Shortly thereafter, in late 2002, Chairman Graham sought to
expand Committee oversight of the CIA's Detenfion and Interrogation Program, including by

having Committee staff visit CIA interrogation sites and interview CIA interrogators.^"^^^ The

inten'ogation process," and that even the chairman and vice chairman would not be told in which

country or "region" the CIA had established its detention facilities?'^^'^ Other emails describe
efforts by the CIA to identify a "strategy" for limiting the CIA's responses to Chairman
Graham's requests for more information on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program,

specifically seeking a way to "getoff the hook on the cheap."^'^^^ The CIA eventually chose to
delay its next update for the Committee leadership on the CIA's program until after Graham had

left the Committee.^"^^Â® At the same time, the CIArejected a request for the Committee staff to

C. No Detailed Records Exist of CIA Briefings of Committee Leadership; the CIA Declines
to Answer Questions from Committee Members or Provide Requested Materials
February 4, 2003, the CIA briefed the new chairman, Senator
Pat Roberts, and the two staff directors. Vice Chairman John D. Rockefeller IV was not present.
The only record of the briefing, a two-page CIA memorandum, states that CIA officers:
"described in great detail the importance of the information provided by [Abu]
Zubayda[h] and [*Abd al-Rahim al-] Nashiri, both of whom had information of
on-going terrorist operations, information that might well have saved
American lives, the difficulty of getting that information from them, and the

importance of the enhanced techniques in getting that information."^"^^^
As described in this summary, and in greater detail in the full Committee Study, Abu Zubaydah
and al-Nashiri did not provide actionable intelligence on ongoing plotting, and provided
significant reporting prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced inten-ogation techniques. The CIA
declined to provide information pursuant to a request from Chairman Roberts on the location of
the CIA's detention site. Finally, the CIA memorandum states that Chairman Roberts "gave his
assent" to the destruction of interrogation videotapes; however, this account in the CIA

record of this briefing.
Throughout 2003, the CIA refused to answer questions from

Committee members and staff about the CIA interrogations of KSM and other CIA detainees.-'^^'^
The CIA produced talking points for a September 4, 2003, briefing on the CIA interrogation
program exclusively for Conrnaittee leadership; however, there are no contemporaneous records
of the briefing taking place. The CIA talking points include information about the use of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, their effectiveness, and various abuses that occurred in
the program.Many of the CIA representations in the talking points were inaccurate.The
CIA continued to withhold from the Committee, including its leadership, any information on the
location of the CIA's detention facilities. On more than one occasion the CIA directed CIA

personnel at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, not to brief a visiting Committee member about the CIA

detention facility there, including during a July 2005 visit by Chairman Roberts.^'^^
I" 2004, the Committee conducted two hearings on the CIA's role
in interrogating U.S. militai'y detainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. CIA witnesses stressed that
the CIA was more limited in its intenrogation authorities than the Department of Defense, but
declined to respond to Committee questions about the interrogation of KSM or press reports on
CIA detention facilities.During the first briefing, on May 12, 2004, Committee members
requested Department of Justice memoranda addressing the legahty of CIA interrogations.

Despite repeated subsequent requests, limited access to the memoranda was not granted until

four years later, in June 2008, by which time the CIA was no longer detaining individuals.^"*^^
While the CIA continued to brief the Committee leadership on
aspects of the CIA's Detention and InteiTogation Program, there are no transcripts of these

briefings. Onebriefing, on July 15, 2004, discussed the detention of Janat Gul.^"^^^ An email
from

Legal stated that the "only reason" the chairman and vice chairman were

informed of the detention of Janat Gul was that the notification could serve as "the vehicle for

briefing the committees on our need for renewed legal and policy support" for the CIA's

Detention and Interrogation Program.^"^^' At the July 2004 briefing, the minority staff director
requested full Committee briefings and expanded Committee oversight, including visits to CIA
detention sites and interviews with interrogatorsâefforts that had been sought by former
Chairman Graham years earlier. This request was denied.
D. Vice Chairman Rockefeller Seeks Committee Investigation

On February 3, 2005, Vice Chairman Rockefeller began a formal
effort to conduct a comprehensive Committee investigation of the CIA's detention, inten"ogation
and rendition activities, including a review of the legality and effectiveness of CIA
interrogations.On March 3, 2005, a CIA official wrote that Vice Chairman Rockefeller was
"convinced that we're hiding stuff from him" and that the CIA had planned a detailed briefing to

"shut Rockefeller up."^'^^'^ The only Committee records of this briefing, which took place on
March 7, 2005, are handwritten notes written by Vice Chairman Rockefeller and the minority

Committee investigation of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, which he and the
ranking member of the HPSCI, Jane Harman, described in a letter to Vice President Cheney
There is no Committee record of a response to the letter.

Apnl 13, 2005, the day before an anticipated Committee vote

oiUh^jicechairman's proposed investigation of the CIA program, the chief of ALEC Station,
and the deputy chief ofCTC, Philip Mudd, discussed a press strategy to
shape public and congressional views ofthe program. As previously detailed, Mudd wrote:

"we either get out and sell, orwe get hanmiered, which has implications
beyond the media, congress reads it, cuts our authorities, messes up our
budget, we need to make sure the impression ofwhat we do ispositive.
The next day, CIA Inspector General John Helgerson briefed

several members ofthe Committee on linuted aspects of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation
Piogram. According to Helgerson, Chairman Roberts' "motive was to have a presentation that
made clear that CIA IG is looking at all appropriate detention and interrogation issues, as (he
told me privately beforehand) the Committee will be voting today on whether to launch their
own inquiry." Helgerson added that "Roberts said 'I know how that vote is going to come out,
but I want the minority to go away knowing this is ingood hands.The proposed

investigation was not approved by the Committee. The Committee nonetheless subsequently
approved legislation requiring CIA reports on renditions and plans for the disposition of highvalue CIA detainees, as well as requesting expanded Committee staff access to the program
beyond the Committee staff directors.In addition. Vice Chairman Rockefeller requested full
Committee access to over 100 documents related to the May 2004 Inspector General Special
Review.^"^^^ On January 5, 2006, after multiple rounds of negotiations with the CIA for the

documents, the chief of staff to Director of National Intelligence Johi^feeroponte wrote aletter

E. InResponse to Detainee Treatment Act, the CIA Briefs Senators Not on the Committee;
Proposal from Senator Levin for an Independent Commission Prompts Renewed Calls
Within the CIA to Destroy Interrogation Videotapes
In October and November 2005, after the Senate passed its version

of the Detainee Treatment Act, the CIA, directed by the Office of the Vice President, briefed

specific Republican senators, who were not on the Select Committee on Intelligence, on the
CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. (The full membership of the Committee had not yet
been briefed on the CIA inteiTOgation program.)^"^^^ The briefings, which were intended to

influence conference negotiations,were provided to Senator McCain;-'^^'^ Senators Ted
Stevens and Thad Cochran, the chairmen of the Appropriations Committee and Defense

Appropriations Subcommittee;-"^^^ Majority Leader Bill Frist;-^^^ and Senator John Cornyn (CIA

records state that Cornyn was not briefed on the CIA's specific interrogation techniques).
Meanwhile, a proposal from Senator Carl Levin to establish an independent commission to
investigate U.S. detention policies and allegations ofdetainee abuse resulted in concern at the
CIA that such a commission would lead to thediscovery of videotapes documenting CIA

interrogations. That concern prompted renewed interest atthe CIA to destroy the videotapes.

F. CIA Director Goss Seeks Committee Support for the Program After the Detainee
Treatment Act; CIA Declines to Answer Questions for the Record
In March 2006, three months after passage of the Detainee
Treatment Act, the CIA provided a briefing for five Committee staffers that included limited

information on the interrogation process, as well as the effectiveness ofthe CIA interrogation
program.The briefings did not include information on the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques or the location of CIA detention sites.-^^^ ^

March 15, 2006, CIA

Areview of the Committee record of this briefing indicates much ofthe information provided by the CIA was
inaccurate. For example, according to the Committee's Memorandum for the Record, CIA briefers stated "the plan
divorces questioning from coercive measures." CIA records indicate, however, that questioning and the use of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were combined in practice. According toCommittee records, CIA
officials stated that Khalid al-Masri had and maintained connections to al-Qa'ida, and thathe was released "when

the CIA reached apoint in debriefings that required [foreign government] assistance," which was not forthcoming.
The CIA Inspector General would later determine that when CIA officers questioned al-Masri, "they quickly
concluded that he was not a teiTorist," and that there was "insufficient basis to render and detain al-Masri." CIA

officers referenced the captures ofHambali, Sajid Badat, Jose Padilla, and lyman Paris, as well as the disruption of
the West Coast/Second Wave plotting, the Heathrow Airport plotting, and the Karachi plotting. As detailed inthis
summary, the CIA consistently provided inaccurate representations regarding tlie plotting and the capture ofthe
referenced individuals. CIA briefers also compared the program to U.S. military custody, stating that "the CIA can
bring far more resources - debriefers, analysts, psychologists, etc. - per detainee than is possible at large scale
facilities such as Guantanamo Bay, Cuba." As described, the chief of Base at DETENTION SITE BLACK

complained of "problem, underperforming" and "totally inexperienced" debriefers almost a year prior to this
briefing. As further described, an inspector general audit completed three months after the briefing described the
lack ofdebriefers at CIA detention facilities as "an ongoing problem." (Senate Select Committee onIntelligence,
Memorandum for the Record, "CIA Briefing onDetention Program," March 8,2006 (DTS #2006-1182).)

interrogation techniques.At this hearing Director Goss explained to the Committee that "we
cannot do it by ourselves," and that "[w]e need to have the support of our oversight
committee.Goss then described challenges to the CIA's Detention and Interrogation

Program as a result of the Detainee Treatment Act, as well as strained relations with countries
hosting CIA detention sites after significant press revelations.^'^^^ Director Goss described the
program as follows:

"This program has brought us incredible information. It's a program that could
continue to bring us incredible information. It's a program that could continue
to operate in a very professional way. It's a program that I think if you saw
how it's operated you would agree that you would be proud that it's done right
and well, with proper safeguards.

Contrasting the CIA program to the abuse of prisoners in U.S.

military detention at the Abu Ghraib prison in Laq, Director Goss stated that the CIA program:
"is a professionally-operated program that we operate uniquely.... We are not
talking military, and I'm not talking about anything that a contractor might
have done... in a prison somewhere or beat somebody or hit somebody with a

stick or something. That's not what this is about."-"^^^
Addressing CIA inten-ogations. Director Goss testified that "we

only bring in certain selected people that we think can give us intelligence information, and we
treatthem in certain specific ways" such that "they basically become psychologically
disadvantaged to their interrogator." Explaining that the key to a successful interrogation was
"getting a better psychological profile and knowing what makes someone tick," Director Goss
stated, "justthe simplest thing will work, a family photograph or something." Goss then
represented that the CIA's interrogation program is "not a brutality. It's more of an art or a
science that is refined."^'^^^

By the time of the briefing, press disclosures had resulted in widespread public discussion about some of the
CIA's reported enhanced interrogation techniques, including the waterboard. Goss was thus asked by a member of
the Committee whetlier the CIA had undertaken a "technique by technique" analysis of the effectiveness of the

program. Goss responded that the problem witli such an analysis is that the techniques were used "in combination."
Asked bythe member for a comparison of "waterboarding versus sleep deprivation," Goss responded diat
"waterboarding is not used inconjunction with anything else." As detailed elsewhere, this testimony was
inaccurate. Gossthenreferred to sleepdeprivation, dietary manipulation, and"environment control" as "alleged

techniques." See transcript ofSenate Select Committee on Intelligence briefing, March 15,2006 (DTS #20061308).

DirectorGoss stated: "I've had to seriously considerwhether passage of the McCain amendment was a

congressional disapproval ofthe CIA use ofEITs. I don't think it was, and I don't think tliat was the message you
sent me. But I have to at leastget thatassurance, that that's not what you were saying to me." See transcript of

After the hearing, the Committee submitted official Questions for
the Record related to the history, legality, and the effectiveness of the CIA's Detention and

Interrogation Program. The CIA did not respond.^'^^^

CIA to provide reports on the CIA's detention facilities (including their locations), the CIA's

interrogation techniques, the impact of the Detainee Treatment Act on the CIA program, CIA
renditions, and the CIA's plans for the disposition of its detainees. The legislation also called for
full Committee access to the CIA May 2004 Inspector General Special Review, as well as
expanded member and Committee staff access to information on the CIA's Detention and

Interrogation Program.-^^ In July 2006, the new CIA director. General Michael Hayden,
provided a briefing for the chairman and vice chairman in which he described the Detainee
Treatment Act as a "safehaven" that potentially permitted the CIA to use its enhanced

interrogation techniques.-^Â®'
G. Full Committee First Briefed on the CIA's Interrogation Program Hours Before It Is
Publicly Acknowledged on September 6, 2006

On September 6, 2006, President Bush publicly acknowledged the
CIA program and the transfer of 14 CIA detainees to U.S. military custody at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba. Hours prior to the announcement, CIA Director Hayden provided the first briefing on the
CIA's "enhanced interrogation" program for all members of the Committee, although the CIA
limited staff attendance to the Committee's two staff directors.Due to the impending public
acknowledgment of the program, the briefing was abbreviated. At the briefing, the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques were listed, but not described. Director Hayden stated that the
techniques were developed at the Department of Defense SERE school and were "used against
American service personnel during their training." He testified that "once [a detainee] gets into
the situation of sustained cooperation," debriefings are "not significantly different than what you
and I are doing right now." Hayden sought "legislative assistance" in interpreting Common
Article 3, stated that he had not asked for an opinion from the Department of Justice, and
represented that he had been informed informally that seven interrogation techniques "are
viewed by the Department of Justice to be consistent with the requirements of the Detainee

Treatment Act."^^"^ Director Hayden declined to identify the locations of the CIA's detention
facilities to the members and stated that he personally had recommended not expanding

Hayden stated that Hamdan v.
had effectively prohibited the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques. He then described an "action" that would define Common Article 3 according to the Detainee
Treatment Act, which was in turn "anchored" in the Convention Against Torture to "which the Senate express[ed]
reservation." As described, two months later, the President sought Congressional approval of the Militai7
Commissions Act. Based on handwritten notes by the Committee minority staff director.

As described above, tlie CIA had sought the Department of Justice's opinion on the application of the Detainee
Treatment Act to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. The draft memorandum was withdrawn after the
U.S. Supreme Court case in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.

Committee staff access beyond the two staff directors alieady briefed on the CIA's Detention

and Interrogation Program.^^Â®"^
There were no other Committee briefings or hearings on the CIA's
Detention and Interrogation Program prior to the Senate's September 28, 2006, vote on the
Military Commissions Act. As described, the Department of Justice later concluded that the

CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were consistent with the Military Commissions Act in
part because, according to the CIA, "none of the Members [briefed on the CIA program]
expressed the view that the CIA interrogation program should be stopped, or that the techniques

at issue were inappropriate."-^Â®^ However, priorto the vote. Senator McCainâwho had been
briefed on the CIA programâtold CIA officials that he could not support the program and that
sleep deprivation, one of the interrogation techniques still included in the program, as well as

waterboarding, were torture.^^Â®^ Members of the Committee also expressed their views in
classified letters to the CIA. Senator Dianne Feinstein informed the CIA that Hayden's

testimony on the CIA program was "extraordinarily problematic" and that she was "unable to
understand why the CIA needs to maintain this program.In May 2007, shortly after
additional Committee staff gained access to the program. Senator Russ Feingold expressed his
opposition to the program, while Senators Feinstein, Ron Wyden, and Chuck Hagel described
their concerns about the CIA program and their "deep discomfort" with the use of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques.

On November 16, 2006, CIA Director Hayden briefed the

Committee.^^Â®'-^ The briefing included inaccurate information, including on the CIA's use of

dramatic change in the American approach to the war on terror in 2009. CIA

H. The CIA Provides Additional Information to the Full Committee and Staff, Much of It

Inaccurate; Intelligence Authorization Act Passes Limiting CIA Interrogations to
Techniques Authorized by the Army Field Manual
On Apiil 12, 2007, CIA Director Hayden testified at a lengthy
hearing that was attended by all but one committee member, and for the first time, the CIA
allowed most of the Coimnittee's staff to attend. The members stated that the Committee was

still seeking access to CIA documents and information on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation
Program, including Department of Justice memoranda and the location of the CIA's detention
facilities.Director Hayden's Statement for the Record included extensive inaccurate
information with regard to Abu Zubaydah, CIA interrogators, abuses identified by the ICRC, and
the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.Director Hayden's
Statement for the Record also listed five examples of captures and four examples of plots
"thwarted" purportedly resulting from information acquired from CIA detainees, all of which

included significant inaccurate information.^^^^ Director Hayden's Statement for the Record
further included the following representation with regard to the effects of legislation that would
limit interrogations to techniques authorized by the Army Field Manual:
"The CIA program has proven to be effective... should our techniques be
limited to the IArmy] field manual, we are left with very little offense and are
relegated to rely primarily on defense. Without the approval of EITs... we
have severely restricted our attempts to obtain timely information from HVDs
who possess information that will help us save lives and disrupt operations.
Limiting our inteiTogation tools to those detailed in the [Army] field manual
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Transcript of hearing, April 12, 2007 (DTS #2007-3158).

2516 pqj.example, the Statement for the Record claimed that Abu Zubaydahwas "an up-and-coming lieutenant of
Usama Bin Ladin (UBL) who had intimate knowledge of al-Qa'ida's current operations, personnel and plans." It
also stated that "[a]fter tiie use of tliese techniques, Abu Zubaydah became one of our most important sources of
intelligence on al-Qa'ida, and he himself has stated that he would not have been responsive or told us all he did had
he not gone through these techniques." The Statement claimed that CIA interrogators were "carefully chosen and
screened for demonstrated professional judgment and maturity," and that "they must complete inore than 250 hours
of specialized training before tliey aie allowed to come face-to-face with a terrorist." Claims made in the Statement
refuting the abuses identified by tlie ICRC were repeated by Director Hayden during the hearing, and are described
in an appendix to this summary. The Statement for the Record also included inaccurate information about past
congressional oversight, claiming that "[a]s CIA's efforts to implement [new interrogation] authorities got underway
in 2002, the majority and minority leaders of tlie Senate, the speaker and the minority leader of tlie House, and tlie
chairs and ranking members of the intelligence committees were fully briefed on tlie interrogation program." See
Witness Statement for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from CIA Director Hayden, for April 12, 2007,
hearing (DTS #2007-1563).
The Statement for die Record included claims of effectiveness similar to those made in otlier contexts by tlie
CIA, related to the captures of Hambali (on which Director Hayden elaborated during the hearing), Issa al-Hindi
("KSM also provided the first lead to an operative known as 'Issa al-Hindi'"), Sajid Badat ("[Ijeads provided by
KSM in November 2003 led directly to the anest of [Badat]"), Jose Padilla ("Abu Zubaydah provided information
leading to the identification of alleged al-Qa'ida operative Jose Padilla"), and lyman Paris ("[s]oon after his arrest,
KSM described an Ohio-based truck driver whom the FBI identified as lyman Paris, already under suspicion for his
contacts with al-Qa'ida operative Majid Khan"). Tlie statement also described the "thwarting" and "disrupting" of
the "West Coast Airiiner Plot" (aka, the Second Wave plotting), the "Heatlirow Airport plot," the "Karachi plots,"
and "Plots in the Saudi Peninsula." See Witness Statement for the Senate Select Committee on InteUigence from

will increase the probability that a determined, resilient HVD will be able to

withhold critical, time-sensitive, actionable intelligence that could prevent an

imminent, catastrophic attack."^^^^
At the April 12, 2007, hearing, Director Hayden verbally provided
extensive inaccurate information on, among other topics: (1) the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah,
(2) the application of Department of Defense survival school practices to the program, (3)
detainees' counterinterrogation training, (4) the backgrounds of CIA interrogators, (5) the role of
other members of the interrogation teams, (6) the number of CIA detainees and their intelligence
production, (7) the role of CIA detainee reporting in the captures of terrorist suspects, (8) the
interrogation process, (9) the use of detainee reporting, (10) the purported relationship between
Islam and the need to use the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, (11) threats against
detainees' families, (12) the punching and kicking of detainees, (13) detainee hygiene, (14)
denial of medical care, (15) dietary manipulation, (16) the use of waterboarding and its
effectiveness, and (17) the injury and death of detainees. In addition, the chief of CTC's
Department provided inaccurate information on the CIA's use of stress positions, while
Acting General Counsel John Rizzo provided inaccurate information on the legal reasons for

establishing CIA detention facilities overseas.^^^^ A detailed comparison of Director Hayden's
testimony and information in CIA records related to the program is included in an appendix to
this summary.
I" responses to official Committee Questions for the Record, the

CIA provided inaccurate information related to detainees transferred from U.S. military to CIA
custody.The Committee also requested a timeline connecting intelligence reporting obtained
from CIA detainees to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. The CIA
declined to provide such a timeline, writing that "[t]he value of each intelligence report stands
alone, whether it is collected before, during, immediately after or significantly after the use of
[the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques].

Committeehad asked for specifics related to the assertion in DirectorHayden's written statement that the

CIA program was effective in gaining intelligence after detainees successfully resisted interrogation under U.S.
military detention. The CIA's response referenced only one detainee, Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi, stating that he was
"unwilhng to become fully cooperative given the limitations of the U.S. military's interrogation and detention
regulations." The CIA's response to Committee questions then asserted that "[i]t was not until Abu Jaf'ar was
subjected to EITS that he provided detailed information [about] his personal meetings with Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi
and Zarqawi's advisors," and that "[i]n addition, Abu Jaf'ar provided information on al-Qa'ida in Iraq (AQI)
finances, travel, and associated facilitation activities." The provided information was inaccurate. CIA records
indicate that, while still in U.S. military custody, Abu Ja'far described multiple meetings with al-Zarqawi, other
members of al-Qa'ida in Iraq, and individuals who were to serve as al-Zarqawi's connection to senior al-Qa'ida

leadership. Abu Ja'far also provided insights into al-Zarqa^'s beliefsandpl^s. See |^^^^|32732

In May 2007, the Committee voted to approve the Fiscal Year
2008 Intelligence Authorization bill, which required reporting on CIA compliance with the
Detainee Treatment Act and Military Commissions Act. In September 2007, John Rizzo
withdrew his nomination to be CIA general counsel amid Committee concerns related to his role
in the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. On August 2, 2007, the Committee
conducted a hearing that addressed the interrogation of Muhammad Rahim, who would be the
CIA's last detainee, as well as the president's new Executive Order, which interpreted the
Geneva Conventions in a manner to allow the CIA to use its enhanced interrogation techniques

against Muhammad Rahim. At that hearing, the CIA's director of CTC,
provided inaccurate information to the Committee on several issues, including how the CIA

conducts interrogations.^^-- Members againrequested access to the Department of Justice
memoranda related to the CIA program, but were denied this access.
On December 5, 2007, the conference committee considering the
Fiscal Year 2008 Intelligence Authorization bill voted to restrict the CIA's interrogation
techniques to those authorized by the Army Field Manual. Opponents of the provision
referenced Director Hayden's testimony on the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation

techniques in acquiring critical information.^^^"^ On December 6, 2007, the New York Times
revealed that the CIA had destroyed videotapes of CIA interrogations in 2005.^^^^ The CIA
claimed that the Committee had been told about the destruction of the videotapes at a hearing in

November 2006.^^'^^ A review of the Committee's transcript of its November 16, 2006, hearing
found that the CIA's claim of notification was inaccurate. In fact, CIA witnesses testified at the

hearing that the CIA did not videotape interrogations, while making no mention of past
videotaping or the destruction of videotapes.

CIA's process of videotaping the inteiTogation sessions or of the destruction of the tapes...." The Committee review
found that in testimony to the Committee in November 2006, CIA witnesses responded to questions about
videotaping in terms of cunent practice, while avoiding any reference to past practice. This was similar to what was
conveyed in June 2003, to David Addington of the Office of the Vice President, by CIA General Counsel Scott
Muller. In June 2003, the CIA's General Counsel Scott Muller traveled to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with White
House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, the Vice President's counsel David Addington, Department of Defense General
Counsel Jim Haynes, Patrick Philbin from the Department of Justice, and NSC Legal Advisor John Bellinger.
According to CIA records, during the trip, White House officials asked CIA General Counsel Muller about the CIA

repeated CIA representations that the CIA interrogation program produced "critical intelligence"
that prevented specific terrorist plots. As described in this summary, and in greater detail in

The President's veto message to the House of Representatives stated that "[tjhe CIA's ability to conduct a
separate and specialized interrogation program for terrorists who possess the most critical information in the war on
terror has helped the United States prevent a number of attacks, including plots to fly passenger airplanes into the
Library Tower in Los Angeles and into Heathrow Airport or buildings in downtown London" (Message to the House
of Representatives, President George W. Bush, March 8, 2008). The president also explained his veto in his weekly
radio address, in which he referenced the "Library Tower," also known as the "Second Wave" plot, and the
Heathrow Airport plot, while representing that the CIA program "helped us stop a plot to strike a U.S. Marine camp
in Djibouti, a planned attack on tlie U.S. consulate in Karachi...(See President's Radio Address, President George
W. Bush, March 8, 2008). As detailed, CIA representations regarding the role of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques with regard to the Second Wave, Heathrow Airport, Djibouti, and Karachi plots were inaccurate.

failed to oveiride the veto.^^^^ On May 22, 2008, the CIA informed the Committee that the
vetoed legislation "has had no impact on CIA policies concerning the use of EITs."^^^*^ As noted,
CIA Director Goss had previously testified to the Committee that "we cannot do it by ourselves,"
and that "[w]e need to have the support of our oversight committee.As further noted, the
OLC's 2007 memorandum applying the Military Commissions Act to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques relied on the CIA's representation that "none of the Members expressed
the view that the CIA interrogation program should be stopped, or that the techniques at issue
were inappropriate.

(^^Sy^^^|[|||||||||||||H/^}F) InJune 2008, the CIA provided information to the Committee in
response to a reporting requirement in the Fiscal Year 2008 Intelligence Authorization Act. The
CIA response stated that all of the CIA's interrogation techniques "were evaluated under the
applicable U.S. law during the time of their use and were found by the Department of Justice to
comply with those legal requirements." This was inaccurate. Diapers, nudity, dietary
manipulation, and water dousing were used extensively by the CIA prior to any Department of
Justice review. As detailed in the full Committee Study, the response included additional

information that was incongruent with the history of the program.^^^^
On June 10, 2008, the Committee held a hearing on the

The CIA response stated that during sleep deprivation, the detainee is "typically... handcuffed in front of his
body," and "will not be pennitted to hang from [the handcuffs]," despite the practice of detainees being subjected to
the technique with their hands above their heads, and reports of detainees hanging from their wrists at

that "caloric intake will always be at least 1,000 kcal/day," although CIA records indicate tliat the puipose of die
diapers in several cases was humiliation and there were no caloric requirements until May 2004. The response
stated that "[n]o sexual abuse or threats of sexual abuse are permitted," despite an insinuation that a family member
of a detainee would be sexually abused. Tlie response stated tliat "[t]he detainee may not be intentionally exposed to
detention facility staff," even though detainees at DETENTION SITE COBALT were walked around nude by
guards. The response stated tliat during water dousing, water "cannot enter the detainee's nose, moutii, or eyes," but
did not acknowledge detainees being immersed in water. Finally, the CIA response described limitations on the use
of the waterboard that were exceeded in the case of KSM. {See Response to Congi essionally Directed Actions cited
in the Compartmented Annex to Report 110-75, June 16,2008 (DTS #2008-2663).) This response was provided
notwithstanding the presidential veto of this legislation on March 8, 2008.

2537 The Committee had been provided four copies of the memoranda for a limited time. See Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence, Transcript ofhearing^un^0^00^DT^^00^698).

deprivation and its effects.^^^*^ Acting Assistant Attorney General Steven Bradbury also testified,
noting that the Department of Justice deferred to the CIA with regard to the effectiveness of the

CIA interrogation program.^^^^ The Committee then submitted official Questions for the Record
on the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and on the effectiveness of the program,
including how the CIA assessed the effectiveness of its interrogation techniques for purposes of

representations to the Departm^of Justice.^^'^^^i^IApi^ared responses that included an
acknowledgment that HB||^|CTC Legal,

provided inaccurate

information with regard to the "effectiveness" of the CIA's enhanced interrogation

techniques.-^"^^ The prepared responses were never provided to the Committee. Instead, on
October 17, 2008, the CIA informed the Committee that it would not respond to the Committee's
Questions for the Record and that instead, the CIA was "available to provide additional briefings

on this issue to Members as necessary."-^"^^ In separate letters to Director Hayden, Chairman
Rockefeller and Senator Feinstein referred to this refusal to respond to official Committee
questions as "unprecedented and... simply unacceptable,and "appalling.

2538 immimcTC Legal repeated the representation tliat during sleep deprivation, detainees' hands were
shackled "about chin to chest level," and stated that "[i]f there is any indication, such as the legs begin to swell, or

things of that nature, that may tenninate the sleep deprivation." mmiUCTC Legal also stated, inaccurately,
that "we cannot begin to implement any of tlie measures, absent first attempting to get information fiom the
individual in an up front and non-coercive way." He added, also inaccurately, that "if the individual cooperates and
begins to talk to you, you never go into the interrogation program."
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Transcript of hearing, June
10, 2008 (DTS #2008-2698).

Questions for the Record submitted to CIA Director Michael Hayden, September 8, 2008, with a request for a
response by October 10, 2008 (DTS #2008-3522).
See CIA document prepared in response to "Questions for tlie Record" submitted by the Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence on September 8, 2008. Tlie Committee had inquired why information provided by Abu
Zubaydah about Jose Padilla was included in the CIA's "Effectiveness Memo" for the Department of Justice, given
that Abu Zubaydah provided the information to FBI Special Agents prior to being subjected to the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques. The CIA response, prepare^uUiewr sent to the Committee, stated that the CTC attorney

who prepared the CIA "Effectiveness Memo," H|||||i|||imH, "simply inadvertently reported this wrong." The

unsent CIA response added that "Abu Zubaydahprovided information on Jose Padilla while being inteiTogated by
tlie FBI," and cited a specific CIA cable,
1099L In contrast to the CIA's unsent response to Committee
questions in 2008, the CIA's June 2013 Response states: "[t]he Study also claims Abu Zubaydah had already
provided [Jose Padilla's] 'Dirty Bomb' plot information to FBI interrogators prior to undergoing CIA interrogation,
but this is based on an undocumented FBI internal communication and an FBI officer's recollection to the Senate

Judiciary Committee seven years later." The CIA's June 2013 Response also represents that "[w]hile we have
considerable information from FBI debriefings of Abu Zubaydah, we have no record that FBI debriefers acquired
information about such an al-Qa'ida tlireat." As detailed in this summary, this is inaccurate. The CIA's June 2013
Response fuilher states that "CIA correctly represented Abu Zubaydah's description of Jose Padilla as an example
of information provided after an individual had been subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques." The CIA's
unsent response to Committee questions in 2008 acknowledged that "[d]uring the initial timeframe Abu Zubaydah
(AZ) was waterboarded the inteiTogation team believed tliat AZ was compliant and was not withholding actionable
threat inforaiation," but ALEC Station "had additional infonnation they felt linked AZ with more planned attacks,"
and that "[a]s a result, the interrogation team was instnicted to continue with the waterboarding based on ALEC
Station's belief." Finally, the unsent responses acknowledged that notwithstanding CIA representations to the
Department of Justice regarding amenities available to CIA detainees, "[tjhe amenities of today evolved over the
first year and a half of the program," and that Abu Zubaydah was not initially provided those amenities.

VII. CIA Destruction of Interrogation Videotapes Leads to Committee
Investigation; Committee Votes 14-1 for Expansive Terms of Reference
to Study the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program
The Committee's scrutiny of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation
Program continued through the remainder of 2008 and into the 111th Congress, in 2009. On
February 11, 2009, the Committee held a business meeting at which Committee staff presented a
memorandum on the content of the CIA operational cables detailing the interrogations of Abu

Zubaydah and 'Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri in 2002.^^"^^ CIADirector Hayden had allowed a small
number of Committee staff to review the cables at CIA Headquarters, and as noted, had testified
that the cables provided "a more than adequate representation" of what was on the destroyed

CIA interrogation videotapes.-^"^^ The chairman stated that the Committee staff memorandum
represented "the most comprehensive statement on the treatment of these two detainees, from the
conditions of their detention and the nature of their interrogations to the intelligence produced
and the thoughts of CIA officers and contractors in the field and Headquarters.After the
staff presentation, the vice chairman expressed his support for an expanded Committee
investigation, stating, "we need to compare what was briefed to us by the Agency with what we
find out, and we need to determine whether it was within the guidelines of the OLC, the MON,
and the guidelines published by the Agency.Other members of the Committee added their
support for an expanded investigation, with one member stating, "these are extraordinarily
serious matters and we ought to get to the bottom of it... to look at how it came to be that these
techniques were used, what the legal underpinnings of these techniques were all about, and

finally what these techniques meant in terms of effectiveness."^^"^^
The Committee held two subsequent business meetings to consider
and debate the terms of the Committee's proposed expanded review of the CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program. The first, on February 24, 2009, began with bipartisan support for a draft

Terms of Reference.-^^Â® The Committee met again on March 5, 2009, to consider a revised
Terms of Reference, which was approved by a vote of 14-1.~^^^
On December 13, 2012, after a review of more than six million

pages of records, the Committee approved a 6,300-page Study of the CIA's Detention and

spring of 2008, after the Committee agreed on a bipartisan basis to continue investigating the destruction of the
interrogation tapes. Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chainnan Bond pressed the CIA to provide the operational
cables promised by Director Hayden. See letter from Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond, to Director
Hayden, April 21, 2008 (DTS #2008-1798); letter from Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond, to Director

CIA Testimony

Sampling of Information
in CIA Records
The Interrofjation ofAbu Zubaydah

DIRECTOR HAYDEN: "Now

Abu Zubaydah was rendered to CIA custody on March H,

in June, after about four months

2002. The CIA representation that Abu Zubaydah stopped
cooperating with debriefers who were using traditional
interrogation techniques is not supported by CIA records.
In early June 2002, Abu Zubaydah's interrogators
recommended that Abu Zubaydah spend several weeks in

of interrogation, Abu Zubaydah
reached a point where he refused
to cooperate and he shut down.
He would not talk at all to the

FBI inten-ogators and although he
was still talking to CIA
interrogators no significant
progress was being made in
learning anything of intelligence
value. He was, to our eye,
employing classic resistance to
interrogation techniques and
employing them quite effectively.
And it was clear to us that we

were unlikely to be able to
overcome those techniques
without some significant
intervention."

isolation from intenjogation while the interrogation team
members traveled
"as a means of keeping [Abu
Zubaydah] off-balance and to allow the team needed time

offfor a break and to attend to personal matters m
as well as to discuss "the endgame" for Abu
Zubaydah
with officers from CIA Headquarters.
As a result, Abu Zubaydah spent much of June 2002 and
all of July 2002, 47 days in total, in isolation. When CIA
officers next interrogated Abu Zubaydah, they
immediately used the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques, including the waterboard.

Prior to the 47 day isolation period, Abu Zubaydah
provided information on al-Qa'ida activities, plans,
capabilities, and relationships, in addition to information

Transcript at DTS #2007-3158. The CIA's June 2013 Response states: "We disagree with the Study's
conclusion that the Agency actively Impeded Congressional oversight of the CIA Detention and Interrogation
Program. ...As discussed in our response to Conclusion 9, we also disagree with the assessment that the information
CIA provided on the effectiveness of the program was largely inaccurate. Finally, we have reviewed DCIA
Hayden's testimony before SSCI on 12 April, 2007 and do not find, as the Studyclaims, that he misrepresented
virtually all aspects of the program, although a few aspects were in error....The testimony contained some
inaccuracies, and the Agencyshouldhave done better in preparing the Director,particularly concerningevents that
occurred prior to his tenure. However, there is noevidence that there was any intent on the part of the Agencyor
Director Hayden to misrepresent material facts." The CIA's June 2013 Response states that the CIA has "identified
a number of broad lessons learned" and includes eight recommendations. The CIA's only recommendation related
to Congress was: "Recommendation 8: Improve recordkeeping for interactions with Congress. Direct the Director of
the Office of Congressional Affairs (OCA)and the Chief Information Officer to develop a concrete plan to improve
recordkeeping on CIA's interactions with Congress. OCA's records going forward should reflect each interaction
with Congress and the content of that interaction. OCA should work with the oversight committees to develop
better access to transcripts of CIA testimony and briefings. This plan should be completedwithin 90 days of the

arrival of a newDirector of OCA."

on its leadership structure, including personalities,
decision-making processes, training, and tactics. Abu
Zubaydah provided this type of information prior to,
during, and after the utilization of the CIA's enhanced
inteiTogation techniques.
Abu Zubaydah's inability to provide information on the
next attack in the United States and operatives in the
United States was the basis for CIA representations that
Abu Zubaydah was "uncooperative," and for the CIA's
determination that Abu Zubaydah required the use of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques to become
"compliant" and reveal the information the CIA believed
he was withholding. At no point during or after the use of
the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques did Abu

Zubaydah provide the information sought.^^''^
DIRECTOR HAYDEN: "This

"overcome what seemed to be Abu Zubaydah's very

internal CIA records. Rather, CIA records indicate that

to focus on developing "learned helplessness" in CIA
detainees.

â¢ Following the suggestion of i^li^HCTC Legal,
CTC contracted with SWIGERT to assist in the

interrogation of Abu Zubaydah.

â¢

As described in the Abu Zubaydah detainee review in
Volume m, almost immediately after Abu Zubaydah's
transfer to CIA custody on March
2002, Abu
Zubaydah's medical condition deteriorated and Abu

Zubaydal^as^nsferred to the intensive care unit of
a
hospital in Country
During this
time, FBI personnel continued to collect significant
intelligence from Abu Zubaydah. According to an FBI
report, during the period when Abu Zubaydah was still
"connected to the intubator" at the hospital and unable
to speak, he "indicated that he was willing to answer
questions of the interviewers via writing in Arabic."
While in the intensive care unit of the hospital, Abu
Zubaydah first discussed "Mukhtar" (KSM) and
identified a photograph of KSM.

â¢

When Abu Zubaydah was discharged from the
hospital and returned to the CIA's
DETENTION SITE GREEN on April 15, 2002, he
was kept naked, sleep deprived, and in a cell with

bright lights with white noise or loud music playing.
The FBI personnel objected to the coercive aspects of
Abu Zubaydah's interrogation at this time, as they
believed they were making substantial progress
building rapport with Abu Zubaydah and developing
intelligence without these measures. (During their
questioning of Abu Zubaydah, the FBI officers
provided a towel for Abu Zubaydah to cover himself
and continued to use rapport building techniques with

the detainee.^^^^)

DIRECTOR HAYDEN: "We

wanted [SWIGERT's and
DUNBAR's] ideas about what

approaches might be useful to get
information from people like Abu
Zubaydah and other
uncooperative al-Qa 'ida
detainees that we judged were
withholding time-sensitive,
perishable intelligence. Keep in
mind, as a backdrop for all of
this, this wasn't interrogating a
snuffy that's picked up on the
battlefield. The requirement to
be in the CIA detention program
is knowledge of[an] attack
against the United States or its
interests or knowledge about the
location of Usama bin Ladin or

The representation that the "requirement to be in the CIA
detention program is knowledge of [an] attack against the
United States or its interests or knowledge about the
location of Usama bin Ladin or Ayman al-Zawahiri" is
inconsistent with how the CIA's Detention and

surrounding their knowledge of terrorist threats and the

The representation that Abu Zubaydah "would not talk" is
incongruent with CIA intenogation records. The CIA
representation that the CIA "knew [Abu Zubaydah] knew

can do?"

Prior to Abu Zubaydah's capture, the CIA had
intelligence stating that Abu Zubaydah was the "third
or fourth" highest ranking al-Qa'ida leader. This
information was based on single-source reporting that
was retracted in July 2002âprior to Abu Zubaydah
being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques. Other intelligence in CIA databases
indicated that Abu Zubaydah was not a senior member
of al-Qa'ida, but assisted al-Qa'ida members in
acquiring false passports and other travel documents.
Still other reporting indicated that, while Abu
Zubaydah served as an administrator at terrorist
training camps, he was not the central figure at these
camps.

After Abu Zubaydah was subjected to the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques in August 2002, the
chief of Base at DETENTION SITE GREEN wrote:

"I do not believe that AZ was as wired with al-Qa'ida

as we believed him to be prior to his capture.
â¢

In August 2006, the CIA published an assessment that
concluded that "misconceptions" about Afghanistan
training camps with which Abu Zubaydah was
associated had resulted in reporting that "miscast Abu
Zubaydah as a 'senior al-Qa'ida lieutenant.'" The
assessment concluded that "al-Qa'ida rejected Abu

Zubaydah's requestin 1993 to join the group."-^^Â®
CIA representations that interrogators "were going
nowhere with [Abu Zubaydah]" prior to the use of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques are also
incongruent with CIA records.
â¢

Prior the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques, Abu Zubaydah provided information on alQa'ida activities, plans, capabilities, relationships,
leadership structure, personalities, decision-making
processes, training, and tactics. Abu Zubaydah
provided this type of information prior to, during, and
after the utilization of the CIA's enhanced

interrogation techniques.

A quantitative review of Abu Zubaydah's
disseminated intelligence reporting indicates that more
intelligence reports were disseminated from Abu
Zubaydah's first two months of interrogationâprior to
the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation

period during and after the use of the CIA's enhanced

CIA *s Enhanced Interrogation Techniques and the SERE School
DIRECTOR HAYDEN: "After

lengthy discussion, [Dr.
SWIGERT] suggested that we
might use the interrogation
approaches that had been, for
years, safely used at the DOD
survival school âin other words,

the interrogation techniques that
we were training our airmen to
resist. Those techniques have
been used for about 50 years,
with no significant injuries,"
VICE CHAIRMAN BOND:

"And the techniques you are
using are boiled down, is it true,
from the SERE school?"

The CIA consistently represented that the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques were the same as the techniques
used in the U.S. Department of Defense SERE school.
However, CIA interrogation records indicate there were
significant differences in how the techniques were used
against CIA detainees. For example, a letter from the
assistant attorney general to the CIA general counsel
highlighted the statement in the Inspector General Special
Review that the use of the waterboard in SERE training
was "so different from subsequent Agency usage as to
make it almost irrelevant."^^^^ Prior to the use of the

CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against Abu
Zubaydah, the chief of Base at the detention site identified
differences between how the SERE techniques were
applied in training, and how they would be applied to Abu
Zubaydah:

DIRECTOR HAYDEN: "All of

"while the techniques described in Headquarters
meetings and below are administered to student
volunteers in the U.S. in a harmless way, with no
measurable impact on the psyche of the volunteer,

environment with great protections and caution - to techniques adapted from abusive tactics used against American
soldiers by enemies such as the Communist Chinese during the Korean War. SERE training techniques include
stress positions, forced nudity, use of fear, sleep deprivation and, until recently, the Navy SERE school used the
waterboard. These techniques were designed to give our students a taste of what they might be subjected to if
captured by a ruthless, lawless enemy so that they would be better prepared to resist. The techniques were never
intended to be used against detainees in U.S. custody."

It is simply not your job. Your job is to tell all what

and agreed upon by the White House."-^^^ Contrary to

the Record that "[alll those involved in the questioning

CIAreco^ suggest that the vetting sought by

reviewed CIA records related to several CIA officers
and contractors involved in the CIA's Detention and

Interrogation Program, most of whom conducted
interrogations. The Committee identified a number of
personnel whose backgrounds includc notable
derogatory information calling into question their
eligibility for employment, their access to classified
information, and their participation in CIA

interrogation activities. In nearly all cases, the
derogatory information was known to the CIA prior to
the assignment of the CIA officers to the Detention

included individuals who, among other issues, had
engaged in inappropriate detainee interrogations, had
workplace anger management issues, and had

reportedly admitted to sexual assault.^'^^'^
Director Hayden's testimony on the required hours of
training for CIA interrogators is inconsistent with the
early operational history of the program. Records

psychologists as interrogators and raised conflict of
interest and ethical concerns." According to the
Special Review, this was "based on a concern that the
on-site psychologists who were administering the
[CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques] paiticipated
in the evaluations, assessing the effectiveness and
impact of the [CIA's enhanced inten-ogation
techniques] on the detainees.In January 2003,
CIA Headquarters requked that at least one other
psychologist be present who was not physically

DIRECTOR HAYDEN: "I'm

This statement is incongruent with CIA records. For
example, from August 4, 2002, through August 23, 2002,
the CIA subjected Abu Zubaydah to its enhanced
inten-ogation techniques on a near 24-hour-per-day basis.
The non-stop use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques was disturbing to CIA personnel at
DETENTION SITE GREEN. These CIA personnel
objected to the continued use of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques against Abu Zubaydah, but were
instructed by CIA Headquarters to continue using the
techniques. The intenrogation using the CIA's enhanced
techniques continued more than two weeks after CIA
personnel on site questioned the legality "of escalating or
even maintaining the pressure" on Abu Zubaydah. CIA
records include the following reactions of CIA personnel
expressing "reservations about being engaged in the

See Volume III for details. As discussed in this summary and in greater detail in the full Committee

98 CIA detainees previously briefed to Congress had been identified. A CIA chart indicated there were "13
New Finds," additional individuals who had been detained by the CIA, and that tlie new true number of CIA
detainees was now at least 112. After the briefing with Director Hayden, the CIA officer sent a record of this
interaction via email only to himself, which stated: "I briefed the additional CIA detainees that could be
included in RDI numbers. DCIA instructed me to keep the detainee number at 98 -- pick whatever date i

provided intelligence reporting are not supported by CIA
records. A detailed reporting chart is provided in Volume

CIA detainees produced no intelligence reports, and nearly
70 percent produced fewer than 15 intelligence reports.
Of the 39 detainees who were, according to CIA records,

nearly 20 percent produced no intelligence reports, while
40 percent produced fewer than 15 intelligence reports.

CIA Detainee Reporting and Captures of Terrorists
DIRECTOR HAYDEN;

"Detainee reporting has played a
role in nearly every capture of
key al-Qa'ida members and
associates since 2002."

The CIA consistently represented that the interrogation of
CIA detainees using the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques resulted in critical and otherwise unavailable
intelligence that led to the capture of specific terrorists, to
include, among others: KSM, Majid Khan, Ramzi bin alShibh, lyman Paris, Saleh al-Marri, Ammar al-Baluchi,

Khallad bin Attash, Sajid Badat, and Dhiren Barot.^^*^
These representations were inaccurate.
The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program Led to the Capture of Hambali and the
Karachi "Cell"
DIRECTOR HAYDEN: "March

2003, KSM gives us information
about an al-Qa'ida operative,
Majid Khan... KSM was aware
that Majid had been recently
captured. KSM, possibly
believing that Khan was talking,
admitted to having tasked Majid
with delivering $50,000 to some
of Hambali's operatives in
December 2002... So now we go
to [Majid] Khan and we tell him,
hey, your uncle just told us about
the money. He acknowledged
that he delivered the money to an
operative named Zubair. He
provided Zubair's physical
description and phone number.

Based on that1 captured
Zubair in June''

The chronology provided in this testimony, which is
consistent with other CIA representations, is inaccurate.
Prior to KSM's capture, in early January 2003, coverage
of a known al-Qa'ida email account uncovered
communications between the account and a former

Baltimore, Maryland, resident, Majid Khan. The
communications indicated that Majid Khan traveled to
Bangkok for terrorist support activities and was in contact

there with a "Zubair."^^^^ By this time, the CIA had
significant intelligence indicating that a "Zubair" played a
central supporting role in Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), was
affiliated with al-Qa'ida figures like KSM, had expertise
in Southeast Asia, and was

suspected of playing a role in Hambali's October 12,

2002, Bali bombings.-^''^ On March 6, 2003, the day after
Majid Khan was captured (the capture was unrelated to
CIA detainee reporting), and while being questioned by
foreign government interrogators using rapport-building
techniques, Majid Khan described how he traveled to

according to plan," and that "KSM told him to provide as
many pilots as he could.
Months later, on November 30, 2003, after three weeks of

being questioned by a debriefer "almost entirely in Bahasa
Indonesia," Hambali admitted to fabricating information
during the period he was being subjected to the CIA's
enhanced intenogation techniques. According to
Hambali, he fabricated these claims "in an attempt to
reduce the pressure on himself' and "to give an account
that was consistent with what [Hambali] assessed the

questioners wanted to hear."^^^^ A November 30, 2003,
cable noted that CIA personnel "assesse[d] [Hambali]'s
admission of previous fabrication to be credible."
Hambali then consistently described "the al-Ghuraba
organization" as a "development camp for potential future
JI operatives and leadership, vice a JI cell or an
orchestrated attempt by JI to initiate JI operations outside
of Southeast Asia." This description was consistent and
corroborative of other intelligence reporting.

A wide body of inteUigence reporting indicates that,
contrary to CIA representations, the al-Ghuraba group was
not "tasked" with, or witting, of any aspect of the "Second

Wave" plotting.2635
While KSM's reporting varied, KSM stated "he did not

DIRECTOR HAYDEN:

The CIA has referred only to Abu Zubaydah in the context
of this representation. As detailed, Abu Zubaydah
referenced religion in the context of his cooperation prior
to being subjected to the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation
techniques. On May 14, 2002, more than two months
before Abu Zubaydah began his August 2002 enhanced
interrogation period, Abu Zubaydah told interrogators that
"if he possessed any more information on future threats,
then he would provide this information to us to help
himself, claiming that 'the sharia' gives him permission to
do so in his current situation.Abu Zubaydah also
made a similar statement to his interrogators
approximately a week laterâagain, prior to the use of the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniquesâstating that he
had "prayed his 'Istikharah' (seeking God's guidance) and
was now willing to tell what he really knew," and "that he
had received guidance from God" to cooperate to "prevent

Further, Abu Zubaydah maintained that he always
intended to provide information and never believed he
could withhold information from interrogators.In
February 2003, he told a CIA psychologist that he
believed every captured "brother" would talk in detention,
and that these "brothers should be able to expect that the
organization will make adjustments to protect people and
plans when someone with knowledge is captured.

As documented in the May 2004 Inspector General
Special Review and other CIA records, interrogators
threatened 'Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, KSM, and Abu

Zubaydah with harm to their families.^^^"^

In addition, CIA officer HjjHHI testified atthe April 12, 2007, Committee hearing: "I spoke witli
Zubaydah. I was at one of these facilities for several months and I spent around 18 hours a day with Abu Zubaydah.
At the conclusion of my time, as I was leaving the facility, he spoke with me, and he said there is something I need
you to understand - to go back to the question that came earlier about walling and a collar. He looked at the
plywood wall in the cell and said I want to thank you for that. I've had a lot of time to sit and reflect, and I
understand why that's there. That's there so I don't get hurt. In terms of the totality of the experience, his advice
was I may have been the first person, but you need to continue to do this because I need to be able to live with who I
am and I will continue to be the religious believing person I am, but you had to get me to tlie point where I could
have absolution from my god to cooperate and deal with your questions. So he tlianked us for bringing him to that
point, beyond wliich he knew his religious beliefs absolved him from cooperating with us." There are no CIA
records to support this testimony.
According to the Inspector General Special Review, a debriefer threatened al-Nashiri by saying "[w]e could get
your mother in here," and, "[w]e can bring your family in here." In addition, one of KSM's intenogators told the
inspector general that the psychologist/intenogators told KSM tliat, if anything happens in the United States,

"[w]e're going to kill your children." {See Special Review, pp. 42-43; interview of]

In an interview report, CIA contractor DUNBAR
described the "hard" or "rough" takedown used at
DETENTION SITE COBALT. According to the
interview report of DUNBAR, "there were approximately
five CIA officers from the renditions team... they opened
the door of Rahman's cell and rushed in screaming and
yelling for him to *getdown.' They dragged him outside,
cut off his clothes and secured him with Mylar tape. They
covered his head with a hood and ran him up and down a
long corridor adjacent to his cell. They slapped him and
punched him several times. [DUNBAR] stated that
although it was obvious they were not trying to hit him as
hard as they could, a couple of times the punches were
forceful. As they ran him along the corridor, a couplc of
times he fell and they dragged him through the dirt (the
floor outside of the cells is dirt). Rahman did acquire a

The use of the "hard" or "rough" takedown, as used on
Gul Rahman, was described by the CIA officer in charge
of the CIA's DETENTION SITE COBALT as "employed
often in inteiTogations at [DETENTION SITE COBALT]

DIRECTOR HAYDEN: "The

allegation in the report that a CIA
medical officer threatened a

detainee, stating that medical
care was conditional on

cooperation is blatantly false.
Health care has always been
administered based upon detainee
needs. It's neither policy nor
practice to link medical care to
any other aspect of the detainee
program."

This testimony is incongruent with CIA records. For
example, as CIA interrogators prepared for the August
2002 "enhanced interrogation" phase of Abu Zubaydah's
interrogation, the CIA's DETENTION SITE GREEN
noted, and CIA Headquarters confirmed, that the
interrogation process would take precedence over
preventing Abu Zubaydah's wounds from becoming

infected.2669 DETENTION SITE GREEN personnel also
stated that delaying a medical session for 72 hours after
the start of the new phase of inteiTogation would convey
to Abu Zubaydah that his level of medical care was
contingent upon his cooperation.On August 10, 2002,

SENATOR HATCH: "Has there

that, under the model of medical intervention that the

DIRECTOR HAYDEN: "No,

detention site was following during the most aggressive
inten'ogation phase, Abu Zubaydah's medical status was
likely to deteriorate to an "unacceptable level" over the

next two weeks.^^^^ On August 25, 2002, the Base stated

absolutely not."

that the "combination of a lack of hygiene, sub-optimal
nutrition, inadvertent trauma to the wound secondary to
some of the stress techniques utilized at that stage, and the
removal of formal obvious medical care to further isolate

the subject had an overall additive effect on the
deterioration of the wound.

Abu Zubaydah lost his left eye while in CIA custody. In
October 2002, DETENTION SITE GREEN recommended

that the vision in his right eye be tested, noting that "[w]e
have a lot riding upon his ability to see, read and write."
DETENTION SITE GREEN stressed that "this request is
driven by our intelligence needs vice humanitarian
concern for AZ.""^^^^
CIA detainees Abu Hazim and Abd al-Karim each broke a

foot while trying to escape capture and were placed in
casts; Abd al-Karim's medical evaluation upon entry into
CIA custody included a recommendation that he not be
subjected to "extended standing for a couple of weeks,"

which was then extended to three months.A cable

describing the CIA enhanced interrogation techniques to
be used on the two detainees stated that the interrogator
would "forego cramped confinement, stress positions,
walling, and vertical shackling (due to [the detainees']
injury).Abd al-Karim was nonetheless subjected to
two 45-minute sessions of cramped confinement,
repeated walling, and a stress position that involved
placing his "head on [the] wall, bent at waist, shuffled

backwards to a safe, yet uncomfortable position."-^^^ As
part of sleep deprivation, he was also "walked for 15
minutes every half-hour through the night and into the

morning."^^^^ A few days later, a cable stated that, even
given the best prognosis, Abd al-Karim would have
arthritis and limitation of motion for the rest of his life.^^^^

Meanwhile, Abu Hazim was subjected to repeated

walling.2680

Subsequently, and despite the aforementioned
recommendation related to Abd al-Karim and a

recommendation from a regional medical officer that Abu
Hazim avoid any weight-bearing activities for five
weeks,inteiTogators sought and received approval to
use standing sleep deprivation on al-Karim and Abu
Hazim.2682

Interrogators left Asadullah, a detainee with a sprained
ankle, in the standing sleep deprivation position. When
Asadullah was subsequently placed in a stress position on
his knees, he complained of discomfort and asked to sit.
He was told he could not sit unless he answered questions
truthfully
Due to a lack of adequate medical care at CIA detention
sites and the unwillingness of host governments to make
hospital facilities available, CIA detainees had care
delayed for serious medical issues. See, for example, the

al-Hawsawi, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Firas al-Yemeni in
